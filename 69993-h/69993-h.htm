<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>These pages were first published in the
shape of letters addressed from Ireland to
<i>Le Temps</i>, during the summer months of 1886
and 1887.</p>

<p>A few extracts from those letters having found
their way to the columns of the leading British
papers, they became the occasion of somewhat
premature, and, it seemed to the author, somewhat
unfair conclusions, as to their general
purport and bearing.</p>

<p>A fiery correspondent of a London evening
paper, in particular, who boldly signed
“J. J. M.” for his name, went so far as to
denounce the author as “an ally of the <i>Times</i>,
in the congenial task of vilifying the Irish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
people by grotesque and ridiculous caricatures,”
which charge was then summarily met
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><i>To the Editor of the <span class="smcap">Pall Mall Gazette</span>.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—</p>

<p>Let me hope, for the sake of “J. J. M.’s” mental condition,
that he never set eyes upon my Irish sketches in
<i>Le Temps</i>, about which he volunteers an opinion. If, however,
he has actually seen my prose in the flesh, and he still
clings to his hobby that I am hostile to the Irish cause or
unsympathetic with the Irish race, why then I can only urge
upon his friends the advisability of a strait waistcoat, a
brace of mad doctors, and an early berth in a lunatic asylum.
I never heard in my life of a sadder case of raving delusion.</p>

<p class="center">Yours obediently,</p>

<p class="right">PHILIPPE DARYL.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>September 18, 1887</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus ended the controversy. There was no
reply.</p>

<p>Allowance should be made, of course, for the
natural sensitiveness of Irishmen on everything
that relates to their noble and unhappy country.
But, what! Do they entertain, for one moment,
the idea that everything is right and normal in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
it? In that case there can be no cause of
complaint for them, and things ought to remain
as they are. All right-minded people will
understand, on the contrary, that the redress
of Irish wrongs can only come out of a sincere
and assiduous exposure of the real state of
affairs, which is not healthy but pathological,
and, as such, manifests itself by peculiar symptoms.</p>

<p>However it may be, a natural though perhaps
morbid desire of submitting the case to
the English-reading public was the consequence
of those exceedingly brief and abortive
polemics.</p>

<p>The Author was already engaged in the not
over-congenial task of putting his own French
into English, or what he hoped might do duty as
such, when Messrs. George Routledge &amp; Sons,
the London publishers of his <i>Public Life
in England</i>, kindly proposed to introduce
<i>Ireland’s Disease</i> to British society. The offer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
was heartily accepted, and so it came to pass
that the English version is to appear in book
form on the same day as the French one.</p>

<p>The special conditions of the case made it, of
course, a duty to the author to strictly retain
in his text every line that he had written
down in the first instance, however little palatable
it might prove to some English readers
and fatal to his own literary or other prospects
in England. That should be his excuse for
sticking desperately to words which, like
Tauchnitz editions, were not originally intended
for circulation in Great Britain.</p>

<h1>IRELAND’S DISEASE.</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

</div>

<p>It is indeed a chronic and constitutional disease
that Ireland is labouring under. Twice within the
last fifteen months it has been my fortune to visit the
Sister Isle; first in the summer of 1886, at the apparently
decisive hour when the die of her destiny was
being cast in the ballot-box, and her children seemed
on the point of starting upon a new life; then again,
twelve months after, in the summer of 1887, when I
found her a prey to the very same local disorders and
to the same general anxiety that I had previously
observed.</p>

<p>Last year it looked as if the solution was nigh,
if Mr. Gladstone’s spirited eloquence was going to
carry the English nation along with it. The seasons,
however, have followed one another in due course,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
bringing with them the usual run of unpaid rent,
eviction, and reciprocal violence; a new Crimes Act
has been added to the long record of similar measures
that the British Parliament has scored against Ireland
in eighty-seven years of so-called Union; a few cabins
have disappeared, have been unroofed or burnt down
by the arm of the bailiff; a few more skulls have been
broken; some hundred thousand more wretched beings
have embarked in emigrant ships for the United States
or Queensland; some more hunger-stricken women
and children have swollen the list of obscure victims
that green Erin annually pays to the Anglo-Saxon
Minotaur. But nothing essential is altered. Things
are in the same places and passions at the same pitch.
The two nations are facing each other with defiance
in their eyes, threats in their mouths, revolvers or
dynamite in hand. The problem has not advanced
one step. Social war is still there, filling the hearts,
paralysing the action, poisoning the springs of life.
It may be read in the alarmed looks of mothers, in the
sullen faces of men; it is lurking behind every
hedge.</p>

<p>Before such an unparalleled case of a whole race’s
physiological misery, how could one help being seized
with an ardent curiosity mingled with pity? Who
would not wish to plunge to the bottom of the matter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
to make out, if possible, the secret of the evil, to
deduce from it a lesson, and, may be, a general law?</p>

<p>That want I have felt most deeply, and I have tried
to gratify it by personal observation; looking at things
through my own spectacles, without animus or hatred,
passion or prejudice, as they came under my gaze;
noting down what seemed to be characteristic; above
all, avoiding like poison the contact of the professional
politician on either side: then drawing my own conclusion.</p>

<p>I need hardly add that for the intelligence of what
I saw, I have always availed myself of the printed
sources of information, such as the standard works on
Irish history, Black’s excellent <i>Guide to Ireland</i>, the
Parliamentary Reports, the national literature, and
last but not least the graphic accounts of current
events published by the English and native press. Of
the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, especially, I must state that I
have found its files a mine of precise, well digested,
and thoroughly reliable information on the subject.</p>

<p>That my studies are above correction, I will not
venture to hope. That they are in every case
founded on facts, and, to the best of my belief,
accurate, I earnestly vouch. As far as possible, I
have made a point of giving the names of the persons
mentioned. When it might have been inconvenient to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
them, however, or when delicacy forbade such a liberty,
I have either suppressed the name or substituted a
fictitious one. It should be understood that what I
wanted, as a total stranger in the country, and what
my French readers wanted, were not personal but
typical instances.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br>
<span class="smaller">FIRST SENSATIONS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Dublin.</span></p>

<p>Hardly have you set foot on the quay at Kingstown,
than you feel on an altogether different ground
from England. Between Dover and Calais the contrast
is not more striking. Kingstown is a pretty
little place, whose harbour is used by the steamers
from Holyhead, and whither Dublin shopkeepers resort
in summer. Half a century back, it was only a
fishermen’s village of the most rudimentary description.
But George IV., late Prince Regent, having
done that promontory the honour to embark there
when leaving Ireland, the place became the fashion.
In memory of the glorious event, the citizens of Dublin
raised on that spot a pyramid which rests on four
cannon balls, and bears on its top the royal crown
with the names of all the engineers, architects,
captains, and harbour officials who had anything
to do with the business. Villas soon sprang up round<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
it, and from that time Kingstown went on thriving.
A splendid pier bent round upon itself like a forearm
on its humerus, makes it the safest harbour in
Ireland, and the railway puts it in communication
with Dublin in twenty minutes. It is the Portici of a
bay that could vie with the Bay of Naples, did it boast
its Vesuvius and sun, and did not the shoals which
form its bottom get often bare and dry at low tide.</p>

<p>You land then at Kingstown, early in the morning
after a four hours’ crossing, having started the evening
before by the express from Euston Station. And immediately
you feel that you are no longer in England.
The language is the same, no doubt, though talked
with a peculiar accent or <i>brogue</i>. The custom-house
officers are English; so are the policemen and redcoats
who air themselves on the quay; but the general
type is no longer English, and the manners are still less
so. Loud talk, violent gesticulation, jokes and laughter
everywhere; brown hair, sparkling dark eyes: you
could imagine you are at Bordeaux or at Nantes.</p>

<p>The guard who asks for your ticket, the very train
you get in, have something peculiar, undefinable,
thoroughly un-English. The old lame newspaper-man
who hands you <i>The Irish Times</i> or the <i>Freeman’s
Journal</i> at the carriage-door, indulges witticisms
while giving you back your change, which not one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
of Mr. Smith’s well-conducted lads ever permits
himself along a British line. As for the passengers
they are more un-English than anything else. This
lady with the olive complexion and brown hair, may
be termed an English subject; but for all that she
has not probably one globule of Anglo-Saxon blood
in her veins. That gentleman in the grey suit has
evidently an English tailor, but the flesh-and-bone
lining of his coat is of an altogether different
make. As for the little man in black who is
curling himself cosily in the corner opposite to you, not
only is he unmistakeably a Roman Catholic priest, but
you must positively hear him talk, to give up the idea
that he is a Breton just out of the Saint Brieux
Seminary. High cheek-bones, bilious complexion,
small tobacco-coloured eyes, lank hair, nothing is
missing from the likeness.</p>

<p>Here is Dublin. The train takes us to the very
heart of the town, and there stops between a pretty
public garden and the banks of the Liffey. The weather
is cool and clear. Inside the station cabs and cars
are waiting for travellers and their luggage. <i>Waiting</i>,
not contending eagerly for their patronage as they do
in London, where any possible customer is quickly
surrounded by half-a-dozen rival drivers. “<i>Hansom,
sir?... Hansom, sir?</i>” The Dublin cabman is more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
indolent. He keeps dozing on his seat or leisurely
gossiping with his mates. “Why trouble oneself
for nothing? The traveller knows how to call for a
cab, I suppose!” So speaks the whole attitude of
these philosophers in the Billycock hats.</p>

<p>This, however, will not prevent their being as unscrupulous
as any of their fellow-drivers in any part
of the globe, when it comes to settling the fare.
“How much?” “Five bob.” On verification you
find that two shillings is all the rogue is entitled to.
You give the two shillings, he pockets them and
rattles away laughing. The job was a failure; no
more.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Dublin is a big city, thickly populated, crossed by
wide thoroughfares, provided with fine public gardens
and splendid parks, which are here called <i>greens</i>, and
adorned with an extraordinary number of statues.
Its traffic and industry are important: visibly, this is a
capital. More than a capital; the focus of a nationality.
Everything in the streets proclaims it: sign-boards,
monuments, countenances, manners. Those marble
statues you see at every step are the effigies of the
patriots who fought for the rights of Ireland. That
palace with the noble colonnade, in the heart and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
finest part of the town, is the very building where
the Irish Parliament, abolished in 1800 by the Act
of Union, held its assemblies. Now-a-days the Bank
directors meet in the room where once met the representatives
of the nation. But they seem to have been
careful not to change anything in the general arrangement,
in case it was wanted to-morrow for some
<i>Assemblée Constituante</i>. You may enter it: the door is
open for every one. On the right you see what was
the House of Lords, a rectangular hall with an open
ceiling, historic hangings, and the statue of some
royalties. On the left, the House of Commons. Here,
mahogany counters stand in place of the members
benches, and where sounded once the clash of
argument, you hear now the tinkling of gold coins.</p>

<p>Let old times come again; let Westminster give
back to the Sister-Isle the autonomy she mourns,
and, as a stage machinery, the Bank will vanish
before the Parliament. It will be an affair of a
night’s work for the upholsterers.</p>

<p>In front of that building, which is the City Hall, it
is not the British flag (though perhaps the law should
insist upon it) that is hanging aloft. It is the green flag
of Erin with the harp and the three towers. Everywhere
there are calls on the national feeling. <i>Hibernian
House</i>, <i>Hibernian Hotel</i>, <i>Erin Stores</i>, <i>Irish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
poplins</i>, <i>Irish gloves</i>, <i>Irish whisky</i>. Above all Irish
whisky! one could not get comfortably drunk with
Scotch whisky, that is evident.</p>

<p>If you visit a museum or picture-gallery you will
find Art exiled in the background, and patriotism
shining to the fore. Bating a fine Giorgione, a
valuable Potter, a Van Steen of large size and extraordinary
quality, a rare Cornelius Béga and a few
others, the collection is not worth much, and would
not fetch its million francs at the <i>Hotel des Ventes</i>, in
the Rue Drouot. It is only a pretext for a national
collection of portraits where are represented all the
glories of Ireland, from Jonathan Swift, Laurence
Sterne, Steele, Sheridan, Edmund Burke to Moore,
Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the Duke of Wellington,
and above all, O’Connell, “the liberator;” and Henry
Grattan, esquire, “true representative of the people,
father of liberty, author of the emancipation.”</p>

<p>Those things take hold of you as soon as you
arrive at Dublin. Like a flash of lightning they
bring light upon many things about <i>Home Rule</i>
which had remained hazy to your continental heedlessness.
A nation with such memories kept up with
such jealous care must know what it wants, and will
have it in the end. Such signs are the manifestation
of a national soul, of a distinct personality in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
great human family. When all, from alderman to
beggar, have one sole aim, they are bound to
reach it sooner or later. Here, if the Town Hall has
its green flag, the urchin in the street has his sugarplum,
shaped into the effigy of Parnell or Gladstone.
Never, since the Venice and the Lombardy of 1859,
was there such a passionate outburst of national
feeling.</p>

<p>In the central part of the town, several streets are
really fine with their rows of large houses, their gorgeous
shops and numberless statues. The women are
generally good-looking; well built, well gloved, well
shod. They move gracefully, and with a vivacity which
is quite southern. They look gentle and modest,
and dress almost as well as Frenchwomen, of
whom they have the quiet grace. The youngest
ones wear their brown hair floating behind, and
that hair, fine in the extreme, made more supple
by the moistness of an insular climate, is crossed
now and then by a most lovely glimmer of golden
light.</p>

<p>Most of the men have acquired the significant
habit of carrying large knotty cudgels in place of
walking sticks. Other signs show a state of latent
crisis, a sort of momentary truce between classes: for
instance, the abundance of personal weapons, pneumatic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
rifles, pocket revolvers, &amp;c., which are to be
seen in the armourers’ shop windows.</p>

<p>But what gives the principal streets of Dublin their
peculiar character is the perpetual presence at every
hour of the day of long rows of loiterers, which
only one word could describe, and that is <i>lazzaroni</i>.
As in Naples they stop there by hundreds; some
in a sitting posture, or stretched at full length on
the bare stone, others standing with their backs to
the wall, all staring vaguely in front of them, doing
nothing, hardly saying more, mesmerised by a sort of
passive contemplation, and absorbed in the dull
voluptuousness of inaction.</p>

<p>What do they live upon? When do they eat?
Where do they sleep? Mystery. They probably
accept now and then some occasional job which may
bring them a sixpence. At such times they disappear
and are mixed among the laborious population;
you don’t notice them. But their normal
function is to be idle, to hem as a human fringe the
public monuments.</p>

<p>Some places they seem to affect particularly;
Nelson’s Pillar amongst others. Whenever you pass
it you are sure to see four rows of loungers seated on
the pedestal, with legs dangling, pressed against each
other like sardines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>Numerous tramcars, light and quick, cross Dublin
in all directions. Five or six railway stations are the
heads of so many iron lines radiating fan-wise over
Ireland. All bear their national stamp; but what
possesses that character in the highest degree is that
airy vehicle called a jaunting-car.</p>

<p>Imagine a pleasure car where the seats, instead of
being perpendicular to the shafts, are parallel with
them, disposed back to back and perched on
two very high wheels. You climb to your place
under difficulties; then the driver seated sideways
like you (unless the number of travellers obliges him
to assume the rational position), lashes his horse,
which plunges straightway into a mad career.</p>

<p>This style of locomotion rather startles you at
first, not only on account of its novelty, but
also by reason of the indifferent equilibrium you
are able to maintain. Jostled over the pavement,
threatened every moment to see yourself projected
into space, at a tangent, you involuntarily grasp
the nickel handle which is there for that purpose,
just as a tyro horseman instinctively clutches the
mane of his steed. But one gets used in time to
the Irish car, and even comes to like it. First, it goes
at breakneck speed, which is not without its charm;
then you have no time to be bored, considering that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
the care of preserving your neck gives you plenty of
occupation; lastly, you have the satisfaction of facing
constantly the shop windows and foot paths against
which you are likely to be tossed at any moment.
Those are serious advantages, which other countries’
cabs do not offer. To be candid, they are unaccompanied
by other merits.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In that equipage you go to the Phœnix Park, the
Dublin “Bois de Boulogne.” It is a wide timbered
expanse of some two thousand acres, full of tame
deer, where all that is young in the place may be seen
flirting, cricketing, playing all sorts of games, but
above all, bicycling. Bicycles seem to be the ruling
passion of the Dublin youth. I have seen more
than a hundred at a time in a single lane near the
Wellington Obelisk. By the way, this was the
very avenue where Lord Frederick Cavendish and
Mr. Burke were murdered five years ago by the
<i>Invincibles</i>. A cross marks the place where the two
corpses were discovered.</p>

<p>The Castle, which the two English officials had
the imprudence to leave that day, is the Lord-Lieutenant’s
official residence. It has not the picturesque
majesty of the castles of Edinburgh or Stirling.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Instead of rising proudly on some cloud-ascending
rock and lording over the town, it seems to hide “its
diminished head” under a little hillock in the central
quarters. You must literally stumble over its walls
to become aware of their existence; and you understand
then why the name of <i>Dublin Castle</i> is for
the Irish synonymous with despotism and oppression.</p>

<p>This is no Government office of the ordinary type,
the dwelling of the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland is a
regular stronghold, encircled with ramparts, bristling
with towers, shut up with portcullis, draw-bridge and
iron bars. In the inner Castle yard are situated the
apartments of the pro-consul, the lodgings of his
dependants of all degrees, the offices where decrees
are engrossed, the pigeon-holes where they are heaped,
all forming a sort of separate city entrenched within
its fortifications.</p>

<p>A very gem is the Royal Chapel, with its marvellous
oak wainscoting, which twenty generations of carvers
have concurred to elaborate. The reception-rooms,
the hall of the Order of St. Patrick, where <i>drawing-rooms</i>
are held, form the kernel of the fortress.</p>

<p>The barracks of the English soldiers and of those
giant constables whom you see about the town are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
also fortified with walls, and form a line of detached
forts round the central stronghold.</p>

<p>England is encamped at Dublin, with loaded guns
and levelled rifles, even as she is encamped at
Gibraltar, in Egypt, and in India.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br>
<span class="smaller">DUBLIN LIFE.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>As there is little aristocracy in Dublin there are few
lordly dwellings besides the Vice-regal castle. This
is very striking in this country of lords and serfs.
The masters of the land, mostly of English origin,
do not care at all to live in the capital of Ireland;
all the time that they do not spend on their property
they prefer to beguile away in London, Paris, Naples
or elsewhere. Few of their tradesmen are Irish;
and the greatest part of the rents they raise on their
lands merely accumulate in the banks of Dublin
to be afterwards spent on the foreign markets.
Thence this consequence, which explains many
things:—The clearest of the nett product of the
country’s one industry—agricultural industry,—is
poured outside it every year, without having circulated
in Ireland, without having strengthened the local
commerce or even invigorated agriculture itself, without
having contributed to the well-being of a single<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
Irishman. Let us set down this nett product, the
Irish aggregate rental, at its lowest estimate,
£8,000,000 per annum, a sum much inferior to
the nominal one, and admit that one-half of it is
sent abroad to absentee landlords. There we have
£4,000,000 leaving the island every year without
conferring the slightest benefit to any one of its
inhabitants. In ten years’ time that represents
40 millions sterling; in fifty years, 200 millions
sterling, or five milliards francs, that Ireland has, so
to speak, thrown into the sea, for that is to her the
precise equivalent of such a continuous deperdition
of capital.... And this has lasted for three
centuries!...<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> What country would not be worn
threadbare by such usage? What nation could resist
it? Which individual, submitting to such periodical
blood-lettings, would not succumb to anæmia?</p>

<p>This anæmia betrays itself, even in Dublin, by many
a symptom. For example, it is not long before one
discovers that the finest shops, in the seven or eight
principal streets, are a mere empty pretence; great
windows displaying all the wares possessed by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
merchant and beyond which the stock is <i>nil</i>. Money
is so scarce that if you want to exchange a five
pound note, in nine cases out of ten you do not get
your right amount of change in specie. They give
you back a quantity of small Irish banknotes, plus
the change in half-crowns and shillings, and that not
without having caused you to wait a long time while
the important transaction was entered in and brought
to a termination, and then only by the united energies
of half the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>There is not in all the city one tolerable <i>restaurant</i>
or <i>café</i> where a stranger can read the papers or obtain
a decent beefsteak. The two or three pretentious
taverns that aspire to fulfil that purpose are horrible
dens, where, without the civilized accompaniment of
napkins, they give you slices of cow, tough as leather,
which are charged for at Bignon’s prices.</p>

<p>Necessity compels you to fall back on the hotels,
where they pitilessly give you the same fare night
after night,—salmon and roast beef. The first day
this can be borne, for the Shannon salmon deserves
its reputation; the second day one begins to find it
indigestible; the third, one would like to see all the
salmon of Ireland choking the head waiter. The
fourth, one takes the train rather than remain any
longer exposed to this implacable fare.... Vain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
hope! it pursues you everywhere: on the shores of
Kingstown or those of Blackrock, in the pretty town
of Bray, or at the furthermost end of Wicklow’s lakes.
It is impossible to travel in Ireland without taking a
dislike to salmon that will last the term of your
natural life.</p>

<p>And yet the fresh herrings of the Bay of Dublin
are eating fit for the gods, and the good wives sell
them in the streets at three a penny. Do not
hope to taste them, however, unless you do your own
marketing, and insist, with conditional threats, upon
having your herrings brought up for breakfast. You
will have a fight to sustain; you will run the risk
of appearing in the eyes of the waiter as a man of no
breeding, one who does not shrink from exhibiting
his morbid tastes to the public view. But your pains
and your humiliations will be rewarded by such
a dish as is not often to be met with in this vale
of tears and bad cooking.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Dublin possesses three theatres, not including the
future Opera-House, for which a site has already
been chosen. The Gaiety, the most elegant of the
three, gives musical burlesques that are rather entertaining,
though they come straight from London.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
But they are acted by Irishmen and Irishwomen, with
all the dash, the brilliancy, the wit of the Celt. The
comic actor of the company neglects nothing to
amuse his audience; extravagant costumes, insane
grimaces, jigs danced in brogues, impromptu verses on
the events of the day,—he has any number of tricks
at his command. That gentleman would score a
sure success at the <i>Concert des Ambassadeurs</i>, with
the ditty that actually delights the hearts of the
Dublin public—“<i>That’s all</i>;” it is about as stupid
as the general literature of the Champs Elysées.
The accomplished and fascinating <i>corps de ballet</i>
exhibit tights of such indiscretion as the Lord Chamberlain
would assuredly not tolerate in London. Is
it that his jurisdiction does not extend to the sister
isle; or does the thing which would imperil the virtue
of club-loungers in Pall Mall appear to him without
danger for those of Kildare Street? The problem
would be worth studying. However that be, a
boxfull of young officers in H. B. M.’s service seem
greatly exhilarated by the display of ankles of
the ladies, unless it be by the port wine of the
mess.</p>

<p>These officers, in plain clothes as they are always
when out of duty, are nevertheless easy to recognise
and seem about the only <i>swells</i> visible in the boxes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
The rest of the audience manifestly belong to the
commercial and working classes.</p>

<p>For it is a fact that there is in Dublin no more
upper middle class than there is aristocracy. The
upper middle class seem not to exist, or to be only
represented by tradespeople, the liberal professions,
or the students. But these young men being, after
the excellent English custom, lodged at the University,
do not count in the pleasure-seeking public.
In other words, they spend the evening in their
rooms drinking toddy, instead of spending it, as with
us, drinking small-beer in <i>brasseries</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The University of Dublin, or rather, to speak more
exactly, Trinity College, rises opposite Grattan’s
Parliament, in the very heart of the town. It
is an agglomeration of buildings of sufficiently
good style, separated by spacious courts, and surrounded
by about thirty acres of ground planted
with ancient trees. Technical museums, lecture-rooms,
refectories, rooms for the Fellows and the
pupils are all to be found there. There is a Section
of Theology, one for Letters and Science, a Musical
Section, a School of Medicine, a Law School, an
Engineering School. Students and Masters all wear,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
as in Oxford or Cambridge, the stuff gown and the
kind of black <i>Schapska</i>, which is the University head-covering
throughout the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Thinking of this, why is it we see so many Eastern
head-dresses in the school of the west? With us
the cap of the professors is the same that Russian
popes wear. The Anglo-Saxons take theirs from
Polish Lancers. That is an anomaly in the history
of dress which ought to attract the meditations of
academies.</p>

<p>Another anomaly, peculiar to Trinity College, is
that the porters (most polite and benevolent of men)
are provided with black velvet jockey caps, like the
Yeomen of the Queen. They take the visitors through
the museums of the place, and show them the plaster
cast taken from the dead face of Swift, the harp of
Brian Boru, and other relics of a more or less authentic
character. The Dining Hall is ornamented with
full-length portraits of the local celebrities. The
library, one of the finest in the world, is proud of
possessing, among many other riches, the manuscript
(in the Erse tongue), of the “Seven times fifty
Stories,” which the bards of the Second Order of
Druids used to recite, on ancient feast days, before the
assembled kings and chieftains. Those venerable tales
are subdivided into Destructions, Massacres, Battles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Invasions, Sieges, Pillages, Raids of Cattle, Rapes of
Women, Loves, Marriages, Exiles, Navigations,
Marches, Voyages, Grottoes, Visions, Pomps, and
Tragedies. This shows that “documentary literature”
was not invented yesterday: all the primitive life of
Celtic Ireland is told there.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The undergraduates at Trinity College do not
seem, as a rule, like those of Oxford and Cambridge,
to belong to the privileged or unoccupied classes.
They are embryo doctors, professors, or engineers,
who work with all their might to gain one of the
numerous scholarships given by competition at the
University. These competitions evidently excite an
ardent emulation. I chanced to pass before the
Examination Hall at the moment when the Rector at
the top of the steps proclaimed the name of the candidate
who had just won the Fellowship. Five hundred
students at least, grouped at the gate, had been
waiting for an hour to hear it, and saluted it with frantic
cheers.</p>

<p>The Fellowship gives a right to board and lodging
for seven years, with a stipend of some £400. It is a
kind of prebend that implies few duties and leaves
the titulary free to give himself up to his favourite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
studies. It has been the fashion in a certain set in
France to go into ecstasies over this institution, and
to regret that it should not have entered our own
customs. The life of a Fellow at Oxford, Cambridge,
or Dublin, was fondly represented to us as an ideal
existence, freed from material cares, devoted exclusively
to the culture of the mind. If we look at things
more closely, we shall see that this opinion is wide of
the mark. We find some of the prebendaries poorly
lodged enough, submitted, by the exigencies of life
in a community, to many a puerile rule, imprisoned
within the narrow circle of scholastic ideas, and in too
many cases buried up to the eyes in the sands of
routine, if not in sloth, or drunkenness.</p>

<p>After all, for what strong, manly work is the world
indebted to these much-praised Fellows?... The
true effort of science or letters was never brought forth
in these abbeys of Thelema of pedantry. Indeed it is
much sooner born of individual struggle and large
contact with the outside world. Even in the English
Universities there is now a marked tendency to
demand from the Fellow a work of positive utility in
exchange for his salary. He must take his part in
educating the pupils, help in the examinations, and in
elaborating programmes; his life is much the same
as that of our <i>Agrégés de Facultés</i>, with a something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
in it of lesser freedom and a semi-priestly character,
if he be a bachelor. But he is free to marry now, and
has been for a few years, on condition that he lives
outside the college buildings.</p>

<p>The students, fourteen hundred in number, live
two by two, in rooms of extreme simplicity, which
they are at liberty to decorate according to their taste
or means, with carpets, prints, and flowers. The
names of the occupants are written over each door.
The rooms generally include a small ante-chamber
and a closet with glass doors. Women of venerable
age and extraordinary ugliness are charged with the
care of those young Cenobites’ abode.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Trinity College was founded by Queen Elizabeth
when she undertook the task of Anglicizing Ireland,
and it has remained to our own day one of the
strongholds of the conquering race. It is only since
the year 1873 that the chairs and offices of this
University have been accessible to Roman Catholics.
Up to that time they were exclusively reserved for
Anglicans, and Mr. Matthew Arnold would exclaim
with good reason that such a state of things was the
most scandalous in Europe. In France, he said,
Protestant masters occupied all the chairs to which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
their merits entitled them; in Germany, Catholic
professors taught history or philosophy at Bonn and
elsewhere; while, in Catholic Ireland, the one University
the country possessed remained closed during two
centuries to all students that were not of the Protestant
persuasion, and for three-quarters of the
present century a Catholic could neither attain to a
chair or to any degree of influence in it.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1845 that the movement began
which was to triumph definitely in 1873, under the
initiative of Mr. Gladstone. A certain Mr. Denis
Caulfield Heron went up in that year for the competition
for a fellowship, and took the first place. When
he was, according to custom, invited to sign the Thirty-Nine
Articles and to communicate in the University
chapel, he opposed an absolute refusal, declaring himself
to be a Roman Catholic; whereupon he was disqualified
by the University Council. Mr. Heron
exposed this judgment before the public, and succeeded
in winning opinion to his side. But it proved an
impossibility to make the Council recall their decision.
The only thing Mr. Heron obtained, after
a protracted struggle, was the creation of a new
class of fellowships, accessible to Roman Catholics.</p>

<p>Finally, in 1873 the College authorities at last
made up their minds to render the offices and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
emoluments of the University independent of any
sectarian denomination; nevertheless the Anglican
spirit remains alive within its precincts, and manifests
itself in the clearest manner upon occasions.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Intellectual life is alive in Dublin, as many a
learned or literary society, a flourishing review, four
great daily and several weekly papers, can testify.
The daily papers especially are edited with a spirit
and humour truly characteristic. It is a well known
fact that the Sister Isle contributes a third at least
to the recruiting of the Anglo-Saxon press, not only in
Great Britain, but in the United States, in Australia,
and in the whole of the English speaking world. The
Irishman a writer or a soldier born, as the Englishman
is a born shopkeeper. The consequence is that
the great papers in Dublin, the <i>Freeman’s Journal</i>, the
<i>Irish Times</i>, <i>United Ireland</i>, the <i>Express</i>, the <i>Evening
Telegraph</i>, are admirably edited each in its own
line.</p>

<p>But the same thing can hardly be said of the illustrated
and coloured sheets that accompany the weeklies,
and which are placarded everywhere. Those
prints, bearing upon the political topics of the day, may
possess the merit of teaching the crowd the lesson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
to be drawn from events; but they are lamentably
inefficient from an artistic point of view.</p>

<p>Ireland, decidedly, shines no more than does our
own Brittany in the plastic arts. Her best painter
has been Maclise, and he is by no means a great
master. However, her coloured prints delight the
hearts of the good people of Dublin. An old newspaper-seller,
smoking her pipe at the corner of
Leinster Street, holds her sides for very laughter as
she contemplates the cartoon given this day by the
<i>Weekly News</i>; it represents a mob of Orangemen
in the act of pelting the Queen’s police with stones at
Belfast. Underneath run the words: “<i>Behold loyal
Ulster!</i>”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The quays of the Liffey are lined with book-shops
like those of the Seine in Paris, to which they present
a certain likeness. Following the quays from the
west, one passes the building where sit the four
Supreme Courts—Chancery, Exchequer, Queen’s
Bench, and Common Pleas. The statues of Faith,
Justice, Wisdom, and Piety rise under its Corinthian
peristyle, which caused the typical Irish peasant, the
Paddy of legend, to exclaim:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>“They did well to place them outside, for no one
will ever meet them inside!”</p>

<p>The judges, chosen by the Queen’s government,
bear the title of <i>Chief Justice</i> or <i>Baron</i>. There are
four at each tribunal, each provided with a salary
ranging from three to eight thousand pounds a year.
They sit in groups of three, bewigged and clad in
violet gowns, with peach-coloured facings, at the
extremity of a recess screened by red curtains. Before
them sit the barristers and clerks in black gowns and
horsehair wigs. The writs and briefs of procedure,
written out upon awe-inspiring sheets of foolscap
paper, are piled up within capacious green bags, such
as are only seen with us at the Comédie Française
when they play <i>Les Plaideurs</i>. The judges appear to
be a prey to overwhelming <i>ennui</i>, so do the barristers.
The public, not being paid as highly as they
are for remaining in this sleepy atmosphere, keep
constantly going in and out. Now and then, however,
Irish wit must have its due: some one delivers
himself of a spicy remark; everyone wakes up a bit
to laugh, after which business quietly resumes its dull
course.</p>

<p>Private houses are built in Dublin on the general
type adopted throughout the British Isles: a basement
opening on the railed area which runs along
the pavement, a ground floor, a first floor, sometimes
a second one. Above the front door a pane of glass
lighted with gas. It is the custom of the country to
place there one’s artistic treasures,—a china vase, a
bust, or a small plaster horse. The small horse especially
is a great favourite. You see it in a thousand
copies which all came out of the same cast. In the
suburbs you notice pretty often a window decorated
with plants that are seen behind the glass panes,—Breton
fashion,—and, striking circumstance, in Ireland
also it is the uninteresting geranium which is the
favourite flower of the poor. Inside the house the
accommodation is nearly the same as in England. It
is well known that nothing is more like an English
house than another English house. But here, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
classical furniture, horse-hair and mahogany armchairs,
and oil-cloth floor, is added a mural decoration
of coloured prints and Roman Catholic chromolithographs,
Saint Patrick, the Pope Leo XIII., the
“Good Shepherd giving His life for the sheep,” surrounded
by dried branches of holy palm, rosaries and
scapularies. An ornament greatly appreciated on the
chimney-piece is a glass vessel full of miraculous water
in which swims a reduction of the tools of the Passion,
the cross, the ladder, the hammer, the nails, and the
crown of thorns.</p>

<p>Eighty-seven per cent. of the Dublin population
belong to the Roman Catholic religion. The proportion
is higher in some other Irish counties: in
Connaught it rises to ninety-five per cent.; nowhere,
even in Protestant Ulster, does it descend lower than
forty-five per cent.</p>

<p>And those Catholics are not so only in name. The
greater number follow the services of the Church,
observe all the rites, maintain a direct and constant
intercourse with the priests. The sincerity of
their faith is particularly striking, and is not to be
found in the same degree even in Italy or in Spain.
For with them the Roman faith is narrowly bound
with traditions most dear to their race; it remains
one of the external forms of protestation against the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
conquest, and has been, till quite lately, a stigma of
political incapacity. To the glamour of the traditional
religion is added the poetry of persecution and
the rancour of the vanquished. This religion is the
one that is not professed by the hated Englishman:
what a reason to love it above all the others! We
must remember that in Dublin, amidst a population
nine-tenths of which are devout Catholics, and where
the remaining tenth is alone Protestant (Episcopalian’
Presbyterian, Methodist, &amp;c.), the cathedral is in the
hands of the Anglican minority with all the ancient
basilics, whilst the worship of the majority is sheltered
in modern and vulgar buildings. The conquering race
has invaded Saint Patrick’s Baptistery as well as the
Royal Castle, and the Senate of the University. A
threefold reason for rancour to these who were thus
deprived of the three sanctuaries of faith, public power,
and learning.</p>

<p>Such spoliations are those which a vanquished race
cannot forget, because they bring constantly their
sore under their eyes. Now the Irish have the artless
vanity of the chivalrous races, and the wounds
inflicted to their self-love are perhaps more cruel than
the others.</p>

<p>This vanity is frequently exhibited in a certain
taste for show, and in a slight touch of the mountebank.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
The least apothecary’s shop in Dublin goes
by the pompous name of <i>Medical Hall</i>; the smallest
free school is an academy; and it is well known that
every single Irishman is descended straight from the
“ould kings of Oireland.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There is a great deal of misery in Dublin; 6,036 of
her inhabitants are inmates of the workhouse; 4,281
are the recipients of outdoor relief; 19,332 are without
a known trade or profession and without means of
living. It makes about 30,000 paupers in a town of
250,000 inhabitants. Besides those officially recognised
paupers, how many others whose distress is no
less terrible for not being classed!</p>

<p>I had the first sight of that misery on the quay of
the Liffey. It was a dishevelled woman walking as in
a trance, her eyes settled, immoveable. Barefooted,
dressed in a yellowish tattered shawl which hardly
covered her withered breast, and in a horrible nondescript
silk petticoat once black, through which her
thighs appeared. She was pale and silent, and
she seemed to be lost in some unutterable grief.
I spoke to her—she did not answer. I put a
piece of money in her hand, she took it without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
a word, without even looking at it. She went her
way.</p>

<p>I thought I had seen the ghost of the <i>Shan Van
Vocht</i>, “The Poor Old Woman,” as the Irish sorrowfully
call their country. She went with long
strides towards the police court—a new building,
not far from Richmond Bridge. I went in after
her.</p>

<p>In the courtyard, groups of beings with human faces
were crouching on the ground—so black, so dirty, so
tattered were they, that they made me think of the
Australian aborigines and Fuegian savages, of the
most unenlightened and degraded tribes of the globe.
Most of them bore outwardly the semblance of women.
The males were standing with their backs against the
wall in that listless attitude of the “unemployed” in
Dublin.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>An ill-kept staircase leads to the audience room.
The walls are whitewashed, the ceiling a skylight,
white wooden benches round the room.</p>

<p>In the chair, the police judge; he is a yellow-haired
man with a benevolent countenance, dressed in a
frock coat. Clerks and counsel are alike gownless
and wigless; everything is conducted in a homely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
manner. The accused follow each other in single file.
The witness (nearly always a constable) states what
he has seen. The judge asks the delinquent if he has
anything to say in his defence, and after a quick
colloquy he pronounces his sentence. Generally it is a
fine of two or three shillings or a day’s imprisonment
for each unpaid shilling.</p>

<p>One of the prisoners has just been condemned to
pay a fine of half a crown for obvious drunkenness;
he does not possess a farthing, but seems to be endowed
with a humorous turn of mind.</p>

<p>“Your honour could as well have said half a
sovereign! It would have looked more respectable,
and the result would have been the same,” he says,
turning his pockets inside out. A guffaw of laughter
joined in by the judge himself, who does not think it
his duty to be offended by the remark; after which
he calls out for number two.</p>

<p>Number two is a boy fifteen or sixteen years old;
he has a sweet intelligent countenance in spite of the
indescribable rags that cover his body. Tears stand
in his eyes and his lips are tremulous. Nothing in
him of the habitual offender. The accusation that he
is lying under seems to be: “Theft of a pork-chop in
an open shop-window.” A single witness is called, a
little maid five years old; so small that her head does<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
not even reach the top of the witness-box. They bring
her a footstool, on which she climbs to give her
evidence.</p>

<p>She has seen the boy, she says, near the shop
window, looking wistfully for a long time on the
chops and finally pocketing one. However, her account
is not very clear. All those people make her
shy, and she does not speak out loud, so the clerk
takes the trouble to read over to her the evidence she
has just given. Does she know how to write? Can
she sign her name? Yes. They place a pen in her
fingers, and with infinite trouble, bending her small
fair head, shooting out her lips, she writes on the legal
parchment with her tiny trembling hand her name
and surname: <i>Maggie Flanagan</i>.</p>

<p>“Well! prisoner, what have you to say?”</p>

<p>The unfortunate boy stammers that he was hungry,
that there was not a penny in the house, and that he
had no work.</p>

<p>“What is your father’s trade?”</p>

<p>“He is gone to Australia, your honour. Mother
has been left with four children. I am the eldest.
We had eaten nothing for two days.”</p>

<p>One feels he is speaking the truth. Every heart is
moved.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shrill voice bursts out from the lower<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
end of the room, wailing: “Oh, your honour, don’t
send him to jail!...”</p>

<p>It is the woman I saw on the quay; the one that I
followed to that Purgatory. The mother of the
culprit very likely.</p>

<p>“I am obliged to remand you for a week in order
to examine the circumstances of the case,” the judge
says, in a manner that shows he is anxious to arrange
the affair with kindness.</p>

<p>The prisoner goes out of the dock following the
warder, and disappears through a small side door.</p>

<p>The mother has gone away without waiting, and I
hurry to follow her. But she walks so fast that I
can hardly keep pace with her.</p>

<p>She passes again on the bridge, walks along the
quay, plunges in a by-street, goes up towards the
south-western quarters of Dublin, called the <i>liberties</i>
of the town. Suddenly I lose sight of her at the
corner of a narrow lane, and after winding round and
round I am obliged to renounce coming up with her.
There is a way of course to come to the relief of
those poor creatures, by sending one’s subscription to
the judge according to the British fashion. But I
wanted to see them at home in their den, wallowing
in their squalor, to see whether men or destiny bear
the responsibility for such dark distress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>Alas! examples are not wanting, and I have only
to cross the first door that opens before me. Along
these lanes yawn dark alleys from which hundreds of
half-naked children are swarming out. All ages are
represented; they are in the most fantastical and
unexpected attire. One has got on breeches fastened
under the shoulders by a piece of cord in lieu of
braces; the same is full of holes large enough for his
head to go through. Another has no shirt, and trails
in the gutter the jagged skirt of a coat slashed like a
doublet, and with only one sleeve left. They are all
of them so extravagantly slovenly that it seems to be
a competition for rags.</p>

<p>A baby two or three years old strikes me particularly.
It is absolutely naked, and so very, very dirty
that dirt has formed a sort of bronzed skin over his
little body, and he is like a juvenile nigger. As he
came into the world so he has remained. Neither
soap nor water ever moistened his skin. He has not
even undergone the washing that the mother-cat
applies so industriously with her tongue on her newborn
kittens.</p>

<p>Yet his mother loves him, squalid and black
as he is. Just now a cart passed, and the baby
was running under the wheels; the mother sprang
out of her lair with the roar of a tigress, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
pounced upon her child, which she jealously carried
away.</p>

<p>Never in London did I hear such accents. Far
from me to hint that English mothers do not love
their babies: but they love them after their own
fashion, without showers of kisses or demonstrative
ways.</p>

<p>And this is the distinctive feature which divides the
Irish pariahs from those of the London East-End.
They love each other, and they know how to put that
love into words. Their distress, perhaps deeper than
English poverty, bears not the same hard, selfish
character—tenderness and love are not unknown
to them. They try to help and comfort one another
in their misery. Thackeray has remarked it long
ago: let an Irishman be as poor as you like; he will
always contrive to find another Irishman poorer still,
whom he will serve and oblige, and make the partaker
of his good or bad luck. And it is absolutely true.
That fraternal instinct, so unknown to the Anglo-Saxon,
nay, so contrary to his nature, shows itself
here at every step.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But the misery is none the less terrible here;
indeed, there are no adequate words in the dictionary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
to express it. No description can give an idea of
those nameless dens, sordid, dilapidated stairs, miserable
pieces of furniture, nondescript utensils invariably
diverted from their original destination. And in that
lamentable frame, those swarming families squatting
in their filth; the starved look of the mothers under
the tattered shawl that ever covers their heads, the
hungry little faces of their whelps....</p>

<p>A sickening smell, recalling that of ill-ventilated
hospitals, comes out of those lairs and suffocating you,
almost throws you back. But it is too late. You
have been caught sight of. From all sides visions of
horror are emerging to light, spectres are starting up;
old hags that would have surprised Shakespeare himself,
swarm round you, holding out their hand for a
<i>copper</i>. The younger women don’t generally come to
the front, not that their wants be less, but they know
that coppers are not inexhaustible, and that the old
ones must have the precedence. So they remain
sadly in the background, and then, when you have
emptied your pockets, there is a roar of benedictions
fit to rend one’s heart with shame. They are so fearfully
sincere! And how many times do we not throw
to the winds of our caprice what would be sufficient
to quench at least for one moment, the thirst which is
raging in that hell! You fly from that den of horror,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
wondering whether the most horrible deserts would
not be more merciful to those destitute creatures than
the <i>liberties</i> of the city of Dublin.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In your flight you fatally fall upon Nicholas Street,
where all those dark alleys open. This is the way to
the cathedral, and the great commercial artery of
this side of the town. If any doubt remained in you
after the insight you had of the houses of the poor in
Dublin, about the way they live, that street alone
would give you sufficient information.</p>

<p>From end to end it is lined with a row of disgusting
shops or stalls, where the refuse of the new
and the ancient world seems to have come for an
exhibition. Imagine the most hideous, ragged, repulsive
rubbish in the dust-bins of two capitals,
and you will get an idea of that shop-window display;
rank bacon, rotten fish, festering bones, potatoes
in full germination, wormy fruit, dusty crusts, sheep’s
hearts, sausages which remind you of the Siege of
Paris, and perhaps come from it; all that running in
garlands or festoons in front of the stalls, or made
into indescribable heaps, is doled out to the customers
in diminutive half-pence morsels. At every turning
of the street a public-house with its dim glass and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
sticky glutinous door. Now and then a pawnbroker
with the three symbolic brass balls, and every twenty
yards a rag and bone shop.</p>

<p>The rag and bone trade is extremely active in
Dublin, which numbers no less than 400 shops of that
description, according to statistics. And that is not
too many for a population which from times immemorial
never wore a garment that was not second-hand.
To a man Ireland dresses on the <i>reach-me-down</i>
system, and wears out the cast-off garments
which have passed on the backs of ten or twelve successive
owners. Battered hats, dilapidated gowns,
threadbare coats arrive here by shiploads. When the
whole world has had enough of them, when the Papoo
savages and Guinea niggers have discarded their
finery, and declared it to be no longer serviceable,
there are still amateurs to be found for it in Dublin.
Hence the most extraordinary variety, and the wildest
incoherence of costume. Knee-breeches, tail coats,
white gowns, cocked hats,—Paddy and his spouse
are ready for anything. So destitute are they
of personal property, that they do not even possess
an outline of their own. Their normal get-up resembles
a travesty, and their distress a carnival.</p>

<p>The main point for them is to have a garment of
any description to put on, since it is a thing understood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
that one cannot go about naked; and it does
not very much matter after all what is the state of
that garment, as it is so soon to leave their backs to
go to the pawnbroker’s. This is a prominent figure
in the daily drama of their wretched existence, the
regulator of their humble exchequer through the
coming and going of the necessaries of life, which
they are obliged to part with periodically.</p>

<p>“You see that pair of hob-nailed shoes?” one of
them tells me, “For the last six months it has come
here every Monday regularly and gone every Saturday.
The possessor uses them only on Sundays;
on week days he prefers enjoying his capital....”</p>

<p>His capital!—one shilling and sixpence, for which
he has to pay an interest of one penny a week; <i>i.e.</i>,
three hundred per cent. a year!</p>

<p>Usury under all its forms blooms spontaneously
on that dung-hill. By the side of the pawnbroker a
<i>money office</i> is almost always to be seen. It is an
English institution, natural in a nation which is
bursting with money, and consequently finds it difficult
to make it render 3 or 4 per cent. What is
England if not a colossal bank, which advances
money upon any three given signatures as a security,
if they come from people with a settled dwelling and
a regular profession? Well, who would believe it?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
Paddy himself is admitted to partake of the onerous
benefits of that credit, provided he work ever so little
and be not too hopelessly worn out. For these
small banking houses form a union and let each
other know the state of their accounts. Upon the
poor man’s signature accompanied by those of two
of his fellows, five and seven pounds sterling will be
lent to him, to be reimbursed by weekly instalments.
But that resource, which is a powerful help for the
strong energetic man, is almost invariably a cause of
distress and ruin to the weak. The borrowed money
ebbs out in worthless expenditure, in the buying of
some articles of apparel or furniture, which soon
takes the road to the pawnbroker’s; and the debt
alone remains weighing with all its weight on poor
Paddy. It is the last straw on the camel’s back, and
he ends by falling down irremediably under it.</p>

</div>

<p>Nothing can be easier than to go from one end to
the other of Ireland. Though her network of railways
is not yet complete, great arteries radiate from
Dublin in all directions and allow the island to be
traversed from end to end, whether southward, westward,
or northward, in less than seven or eight hours.
The journey from south to north, following the great
axis, is longer and more complicated, for it is necessary
to change lines several times. The circular
journey along the coasts is facilitated by excellent
services of open coaches, that go through the regions
not yet penetrated by railways. Lastly, one can, by
following the Shannon, enter by steamboat almost
to the very heart of the country.</p>

<p>When one has gone through those various excursions,
completed by riding and walking tours, and seen
the island under its various aspects, one perceives that
it presents in a general manner the appearance of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
cup, with brims rising towards the sea; in other
words, it consists in a vast central plain, protected on
all its circumference by groups of hills and mountains,
preventing the inroad of the ocean. Those
mountains are in no part very high; the finest, those
of Kerry, do not rise above 1800 feet. But their
very position on the brink of the Atlantic, the erosions
undermining their base, the deep bays they delineate,
the innumerable lakes hidden away in their bosoms,
lend them a majesty far above their altitude. Bland
and smiling in Wicklow, they are in Kerry of an
unequalled serenity, while in Connemara they preserve
unbroken the rude chaos of primeval cataclysms,
and display on the north of Antrim’s table-land,
towards the Giant’s Causeway, the most
stupendous basaltic formations.</p>

<p>Yet the normal, the truest aspect of Ireland, is
represented by the central plain—a large, unbroken
surface of green undulating waves, ever bathed in a
damp and fresh atmosphere, shut in on the horizon
by dark blue mountains.</p>

<p>This aspect is of infinite sweetness; no land possesses
it in a similar degree. It takes possession of
you, it penetrates you like a caress and a harmony.
One understands, when submitted to that entirely
physical influence, the passionate tenderness that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Irishmen feel for their country, and that is best illustrated
by Moore’s poetry. The sky seems to have
endeavoured to find the true chord in response to the
earth, in order to give to all things those deliciously
blended tones. The stars are nearly always seen
through a light haze, and the sun itself shines but
through a veil of vapours, into which it seems eager
to disappear again. The shadows are not hard and
well defined; they melt into each other by insensible
gradations of tint. All is green, even the stones,
clothed in moss; the walls, covered with ivy; the
waters, hidden under a mantle of reeds and water-lilies.
In other climes the fields, after a spring
shower, take unto themselves the bravery that here is
seen in all seasons. In the full heat of July the corn,
the barley, the oats still keep their April dress. Do
they ever ripen? They say they do, towards the end
of October; but surely they never can get yellow.
Yellow is not an Irish colour, nor is white. Ireland is
indeed green Erin, the Emerald Isle. Never was
name more truly given.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One could consider Ireland as a prodigious grass
plot of some twenty million acres, constantly watered
by rain. Water is everywhere: in the clouds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
that the winds of the Atlantic drive over her, and
that the highlands of Scotland and Norway stop in
their course; on the soil, where all hollows, great or
small, become lakes; under the ground even, where
the roots of vegetables, saturated and swollen like
sponges, slowly change into peat. Ireland is the most
liberally watered country in Europe, and yet, thanks
to the constancy of the winds over her, one can
scarcely say it is a damp country. The fall of water
is on an average of 926 millimetres in a year—a little
over three feet. The ground, naturally of admirable
fruitfulness, is still further favoured by the mildness
and equableness of the climate on the shores.</p>

<p>The flora almost recalls that of the Mediterranean
coasts. The fauna presents the remarkable peculiarity
of not possessing a single dangerous or even repulsive
species—not one toad, not one reptile, except the most
innocent among them all, the “friend of man,” the
lizard. Legends say that St. Patrick, the Christian
apostle of the isle, coming from Brittany in the 6th
century, threw all the serpents into the sea, and all
the toads after them; indeed, he is habitually represented
in popular imagery as engaged in performing
that miracle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>An island possessing no backbone, and presenting
generally the appearance of a cup, cannot have great
rivers. In fact, almost all the rivers of Ireland, born
within her girdle of mountains, soon lose themselves
in the sea, forming at their mouth an estuary that
takes the name of <i>Lough</i>, as do the lakes proper.
One only creates an exception by the length of its
course and the volume of its waters—the Shannon,
rising in the central table-land, imprisoned, so to
speak, at the bottom of the circular well, and whose
course, impeded above Limerick by a barrier of rocks,
form fine rapids, under which the waters flow in a
majestic stream. With the tide, vessels of the heaviest
tonnage can go up the river to Foynes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Indeed, the country lacks no harbours on those
deeply indented shores. North, west, east, and south,
Ireland counts no less than fourteen natural harbours,
large enough to shelter whole fleets.</p>

<p>But this gift, like all the others that Fate has showered
on her, seems to have turned against her by bringing
the nations of prey within those bays. Thrown as an
outwork of Europe in the middle of the ocean, she
seemed to be opening her arms to the Phœnicians, to
the Scandinavians; later on to the Arabs, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Spaniards, and the English. A gust of wind was
enough to reveal her to them; a favourable breeze to
bring them back. To understand clearly the perils
of such a post, and to see how much more still than
the muzzle of Brittany, Ireland is Atlantic land, one
must go to Valencia, the small islet on which come to
shore the ends of the Transatlantic cables.</p>

<p>More than in any other spot of Europe one feels at
the farthest end of the world there. It seems as if, by
stretching one’s arm, one would reach the United
States. And, in fact, one is near enough as it is—five
or six days by steam—almost within speaking
distance with the telephone. So fast travel the
storms from America that the telegram is hardly
able to arrive before them. A sea-gull, borne on the
wing of the hurricane, would cross that arm of the sea
in a few hours. The breeze that blows in your face
may have stirred the hair of a Brooklyn belle in the
morning. There one feels how very small is our
globe.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Geologically, Ireland differs much from Great
Britain. The island appeared much earlier, and its
structure is special. Alone, its northern part, or Ulster,
which, from a political point of view, forms such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
striking contrast with the rest of the island, presents
between Donegal Bay and Dundalk Bay, mountainous
masses, entirely analogous with those of Scotland,
towards which they advance, and of which they
appear originally to have formed a part. They are
basaltic rocks, or petrified streams of lava, while
the mountains in Kerry or Connemara are red
sandstone and slate, lying above the carbonaceous
strata.</p>

<p>What ought, in fact, to be considered as Ireland
proper consists, then, of the eastern province or
Leinster, the southern or Munster, and the western or
Connaught. Ulster is in reality, as well by the nature
of its soil as by the race and habits of the majority of
its inhabitants, an annex and dependency of Scotland.
The three other provinces, on the contrary, form a
whole, as distinct from England or Scotland by the
constitution and aspect of the land, as it is different
by the race, genius, the traditions and beliefs of the
population.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The most striking thing on a first sight of the Irish
landscape is the total absence of trees of any kind.
They are only seen in private parks. As far as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
eye can see the plains spread in gentle undulations,
covered with grass and intersected with stone walls;
no single oak, elm, or shrub ever comes to break its
monotony. The tree has become a lordly ensign.
Wherever one sees it one may be certain the landlord’s
mansion is not far.</p>

<p>That radical disappearance of the forests, in a
country once covered with them, is singular. A great
many explanations have been given of this fact,—explanations
that went back as far as some geological
cataclysm. Such theories are no longer acceptable
in these days. The most likely supposition is that
all the available timber has gradually been felled
down for domestic uses, and that indifference, poverty,
incessant war, incertitude as to the present or future,
have, from the remotest times, prevented those sad
gaps being repaired.</p>

<p>On the lower land the absence of timber is
explained of itself by the apparition of deep layers
of turf, whose depth is sometimes from forty-five
to sixty feet, in which whole oak trees have been
discovered in a more or less advanced state of carbonisation.
At a certain stage of this transformation
the ligneous tissue has become of such flexibility that
the Irish cut it into stripes and use it to make straps,
fishing nets, bands of all kinds,—not to mention the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
pious trifles, pipes, small figures carved with a knife,
and various <i>souvenirs</i> with which they pester the
tourist.</p>

<p>The turf pits are a great source of riches for Ireland,
and furnish the only fuel commonly used by
the lower classes. In the country one sees everywhere
people engaged in extracting peat, cutting it
into cakes, erecting these cakes in pyramids to be
allowed to dry in the sun, or transporting them from
one place to the other. The people working at it are,
indeed, almost the only ones visible in the fields. One
might think that the extracting and manipulating
of the turf were the only industry of the
country.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of turf, the red and the black,
according to the degree of carbonisation attained by
the layers, and the nature of the vegetable matter
that formed them. The finest is of such intense and
brilliant black, that it might almost be mistaken for
coal. Those vast reservoirs of fuel, known in Ireland
by the name of <i>bog</i>, are a constant feature of the
landscape in the valleys of the mountainous girdle
as in the lower parts of the plain. The total depth
of these open carbon mines is estimated at no less
than sixty million cubic feet; they occupy an area
almost equal to the seventh part of the total<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
superficies of the island, and the lakes cover another
seventh part.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One other striking peculiarity of the scenery in
Ireland is the scarcity of cultivated fields. One can
count them, dotted here and there, almost always
planted with oats, potatoes, or turnips. The statistics
of the Agricultural Society give, in round numbers,
for twenty millions of acres of total surface, five
millions, or a quarter in cultivated ground; that is,
150,000 acres only in cereals, 350,000 in turnips, one
million and a half in potatoes, two million in artificial
meadows. Ten million of acres are in natural meadows;
the rest are fallow lands, bog or turf, waste
land, roads and highways.</p>

<p>Those roads and highways, as well as the bridges
and all the public works depending upon the English
Government, are admirably kept. It is clear that on
that point Dublin Castle is resolved to give no handle
to criticism. Those splendid tracks of road, laid
across waste and desert land, even produce a curious
effect, and one would be tempted to see an affectation
about it, did they not, in the majority of cases, lead
to some magnificent private property, spreading as
far as one can see over hill and dale, always shut in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
by stone walls eight or ten feet high, enclosing an
area of several miles.</p>

<p>As for the conveyances that are seen on these
Appian Ways they are of two kinds; either the
smart carriage whose cockaded coachman drives magnificent
horses, or the diminutive cart drawn by a
small donkey, carrying, besides the grand-dame or child
that drives it, a sort of conical-shaped utensil held in
its place with cords and oftener filled with water than
with milk. One must go to Morocco or Spain to see
donkeys in such numbers as in Ireland.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One thing surprises in those endless pastures—it is
to count so few grazing beasts on them. Not that
they are altogether excluded; now and then one
perceives on the intense green of the fields reddish
or white spots that are cattle or sheep, the rounded
haunch of a mare, the awkward frolics of a foal. On
the brinks of rivers that one can almost always cross
wading, one sometimes sees a few happy cows, their
feet in the water, wide-eyed and munching dreamily.
Here and there one sees geese, hens escorted by their
chicks, pigs fraternally wallowing with children in the
muddy ditch. But in a general way the landscape is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
wanting in animated life, and as poor in domestic
animals as in labourers.</p>

<p>As a contrast game is plentiful, as is natural in a
land that is three-quarters uncultivated, where it is
forbidden to carry arms, and where shooting is the
exclusive privilege of a very small minority. Hares
and rabbits seem to enjoy their immunity to the
utmost, and everywhere their white breeches are
seen scudding away in the dewy grass like fireworks.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Villages are rare, and rarer still is farmhouse or
homestead. Undulating ridges succeed to undulating
ridges and still one sees no trace of any dwellings.
One might think that these stone walls radiating over
the fields had sprung there of their own accord, and
that the hay is doomed to rot standing, after feeding
the butterflies. Yet that cannot be—evidently some
one must come now and then to cut this grass, make
it into stacks and carry it away.... At last, by dint
of stretching neck and legs you succeed in discovering
far away on the horizon a spire that belongs to a
big borough, a market-town rather, where those civic
tillers of the soil dwell in houses similar to those of
the <i>liberties</i> in Dublin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>As for the mud cabin, generally described as the
Irish peasant’s only home, it is now a thing of the
past. One would hardly, and after much research,
find some specimens of it in the farthest counties, at
the end of Kerry or Mayo.</p>

<p>True to say, when found, those specimens leave
nothing to be desired for poverty and discomfort; no
fire-place, no windows, no furniture; nothing but a
roof of turf supported by a few poles on mud walls.
The very pig that formerly shared its luxuries with
the <i>genus homo</i> and indicated a certain degree of
relative comfort in his possessor, the pig himself has
disappeared for ever.</p>

<p>But those are exceptions, almost pre-historic cases.
As a rule the mud cabin has been blotted out from
the Irish soil—perhaps enlightened landlords systematically
pursued its eradication; perhaps the
peasants, tired of its tutelary protection, emigrated
under other skies,—or more simply still, they took
advantage of the last famine to die of hunger. Upon
which came the rain, and two or three years sufficed
to dilute the walls, render the mud house to the
common reservoir, and wash out its very remembrance.</p>

<p>The population of Ireland, it must be borne in
mind, has been steadily decreasing for half a century.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
It was of 8,175,124 inhabitants in 1841; of 6,552,385
in 1851; 5,798,584 in 1861; 5,412,377 in 1871; and
5,174,836 in 1881. By all appearances it must now
have sunk under five millions. If this fish-eating
race was not the most prolific under the sun it would
have been blotted out long ago from the face of this
planet.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br>
<span class="smaller">THE RACE.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The essential character of Irish scenery is, besides
the green colour and the absence of trees, the frequent
ruins that meet the eyes everywhere—one cannot go
two steps without seeing them. Ruins of castles,
abbeys, churches, or even humble private dwellings.
There are quarters of large towns or boroughs, such
as for instance the northern one in Galway, that
might be taken at night, with their sinister looking rows
of houses, roofless and with gaping walls, for a street
in Herculaneum or Pompeii. When the ancient stone
walls are those of a church or chapel, they generally
serve as a setting for the legends of the countryside;
there occurred all the terrifying tales of former
days, there took place all the local miracles, and there
still is the favourite haunt of illustrious spirits, of
fairies and <i>banshee</i>.</p>

<p>Almost in every case the graves of a hamlet come
to group themselves at the foot of those ivy-clothed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
old walls, by an instinctive and touching effect of the
Irishman’s passionate love for the traditions of his
race; and those graves, generally covered with great
slabs of stone, scattered among the tall grasses, wild
and moss-grown, without cross or emblem of any
sort, well accord with the melancholy aspect of the
site.</p>

<p>Sometimes near these ruins and graves is still seen,
proudly raising its head, one of those monuments
peculiar to the country and about which antiquaries
are at such variance,—the round towers of Ireland:
slender and bold turrets, slightly conical in shape, not
unlike minarets 75 or 80 feet high, upon a base
15 to 18 feet broad, and springing from the ground
like obelisks. They are built of large stones, sometimes
rough, sometimes cut, but always cemented
together, a fact which gave rise to the opinion that
they must be posterior to the invasion of Great
Britain by the Romans. But that is simply begging
the question and is justified by nothing; moreover,
the absence of any tradition about the origin or use
of those towers make such a tale appear in the
highest degree improbable. A race was never seen
to borrow the technical industry of another race
to apply it to the construction of monuments that are
essentially their own. Celtic civilization had attained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
in Ireland, centuries before the Romans, to a degree
of perfection witnessed by the Brehon Code, compiled
at least five or six centuries before the
Christian era, and the first among human laws that
substituted arbitrage to brute force. A people
capable of submitting to the law of reason and who
knew enough of mechanics to erect monoliths of
twenty-four thousand cubic feet could well discover
alone the art of mixing mortar, and need not borrow
it from the Romans, who besides did not set foot in the
country. Never was hypothesis more childish or more
unfounded. The truth is that nothing is known about
the round towers, as is the case with the <i>nurraghs</i> of
Sardinia; that all those monuments are anterior to
any positive traditions and have been built for uses
of which we have no conception. At the most one
might suppose from their aspect, which is that of
inland lighthouses, that they may have been used
as military or astronomical observatories, and, perhaps,
bore on their summit a sacred fire visible throughout
a whole district. In such a case the only guide to be
followed with any certainty is the eternal fitness
between organ and function.</p>

<p>Eighty-three of these towers are still standing in
Ireland, and their dilapidated condition allows it to
be supposed that they may once have been much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
more numerous. Whatever may have been their
origin, they remain so narrowly and so fitly associated
in the popular imagination with the Irish idea of
nationality that the image of a round tower naturally
grew under the chisel of the sculptor, as an emblem of
patriotism, on the tomb of O’Connell in the cemetery
of Dublin.</p>

<p>Megalithic monuments and dolmen are equally
found in great numbers in Ireland. Donegal presents
at Raphre a circus of raised stones absolutely similar
to that of Stonehenge, while in Derry one sees in
the Grianan of Aileach the finest fortified temple
that was ever raised in honour of the sun. In many
districts all the hills or mountains without exception
are crowned with the funeral hillock or Celtic <i>rath</i>.
As for the Druidical inscriptions in the <i>Ogham</i>
character, consisting of twenty-five combinations of
oblique or vertical strokes corresponding to an equal
number of sounds, they abound in all the counties.
The most curious is that of the Cave of Dunloe, discovered
by a labourer, in the vicinity of Killarney,
in the year 1838; it may be considered a true
Druidical library, of which the books are represented
by the stones of the vaulted roof. Those characters
have been deciphered now, thanks to bilingual inscriptions
posterior to the Roman period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>Lastly, the names of places and the geographical
definitions are, in nine cases out of ten, of Celtic
origin, according to the tables drawn out by Chalmers.
The mountains are called <i>ben</i>, and the chains of hills
<i>sliebh</i>, rocks are <i>carricks</i> or <i>cloagh</i>, lakes <i>loughs</i>, an
island <i>innis</i>, bogs <i>corks</i>, lands <i>curraghs</i>, hills <i>knocks</i>,
rivers <i>anagh</i>.</p>

<p>The Erse tongue, still spoken by a twelfth part of
the population, is sister to the Gaelic and the Breton.
It denominates a field <i>agh</i>, a ford <i>ath</i>, a village <i>bally</i>,
a city <i>cahir</i>, <i>ban</i> what is white or beautiful, <i>deargh</i>
what is red, <i>dua</i> what is black, <i>beg</i> what is small, and
<i>mor</i> what is big, <i>clar</i> a plain, <i>teach</i> a house, <i>donagh</i> a
church, <i>ross</i> a wooded hillside.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As for the type of the Irish race it is undeniably
Celtic, or at least essentially different from the Anglo-Saxon.
The hair is black or brown, the eyes dark,
the complexion pale, the nose short, the forehead
bony. The general appearance is vigorous and active,
the movements are quick and often graceful; the stature
without being low, is nearer to middle height than is
generally the case in a British country. The rudest
peasant girls often have a sculptural grace of attitude;
one sees them in the fields, carrying burdens on their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
head with that stateliness of Greek canephores which
seems as a rule the exclusive attribute of the daughters
of the East.</p>

<p>Still more different from the English is the inner
man; naturally mirthful and expansive, witty, careless,
even giddy, quarrelsome from mere love of noise,
prompt to enthusiasm or despondency, imbued with
the love of literary form and legal subtleties, he is
the Frenchman of the West, as the Pole or the
Japanese are Frenchmen of the East. And always
there has been an affinity of nature, a harmony of
thought, between them and us. At once we feel we are
cousins. Their ancestors formerly came in thousands
to fight under our flag. Our revolutions were always
felt in Ireland. So strong, for nations as well as
individuals, is that mysterious tie of a common origin,
or even the most remote consanguinity.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Does this mean that the Irishman, thanks to his
insular position, has escaped all cross breeding and
remained pure Celt? Far from it. No country was
oftener or more cruelly invaded than his. The stranger
implanted himself in it, begat his children there, introduced
in the race elements that are still recognizable;
for example, that most peculiar expression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
of the eyes, the height of the cheek-bones, the outline
of the temples and cranium, which are in many cases
clearly Scandinavian.</p>

<p>In the origin of history the primitive inhabitants of
Erin, the Firbolgs (men with the skin of beasts) were
vanquished by the Thuathan-de-Danan, “the fairy
people,” who came from the East, and who founded
the realm of Innisfallen, or Island of Fate. A
Spanish invasion (probably Phenician), that of the
Milesians, overthrew that establishment ten or twelve
centuries before the Christian era, and three hundred
years before the foundation of Rome. After that
came an uninterrupted list of one hundred and
ninety-seven Milesian kings, who reached to the
arrival of the Northmen, in the eighth century of
the present era. Under their rule Ireland enjoyed
a profound peace. It was during this period of
more than a thousand years that flourished and
developed in the island of Erin an entirely original
civilization, characterised by the Brehon Code, by
customs of great gentleness, by institutions of admirable
prudence, among others that of a national
militia, the <i>Fiana-Erin</i>, or <i>Fenians</i>, who were recruited
by voluntary enlistment, defended the country
and maintained order therein, while the citizens
pursued their various avocations,—agriculture, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
which they excelled, fishing and navigation, for which
they displayed some ability.</p>

<p>Divided into five or six small independent kingdoms
Ireland, without her militia, would have fallen an easy
prey to the Britons, the Gauls, or the Caledonians,
and later on to the Romans. Thanks to that national
force,—a true civic guard, quartered during winter on
the inhabitants, and ever popular, which proves that
it knew how to preserve intact the tradition of Celtic
virtues,—Ireland, alone almost among European
nations, escaped a Roman invasion. After twelve
hundred years the remembrance of the Fenians has
remained so vivid in the hearts of the people that the
Irish Republicans of America, when they resumed
in our own days the struggle in arms against England,
naturally chose the name of the ancient defenders of
national independence.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>With the fall of the Roman Empire and the dying
out of the fear of invasion, the Fenian institution disappeared.
The military instincts of the nation then
manifested themselves at the exterior by frequent
incursions made by Irish adventurers in England,
Scotland, or Gaul. It was in one of those incursions
off the coast of Brittany that Niall Mor, King of Tara,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
took prisoner, with several other young Christians, a
boy named Sucoth, and whom they called <i>Patricius</i>
(Patrick) on account of his noble origin. This was at
the end of the fourth century of our era. The prisoner
was employed in tending flocks in Ireland, spent seven
years there, and at last found an opportunity of escaping
to his own country. When back in Brittany, he
constantly thought with grief of the dreadful destiny
of the Irish, who still remained in ignorance of the
true religion, and vegetated in the darkness of
Druidism. One night he had a prophetic dream,
after which he resolved to dedicate himself to the
evangelization of those unhappy heathens. To this
effect he went to the town of Tours, where he assumed
the religious habit, then on to Rome, where he entered
the missionary seminary. In the year 432 he was at
the Barefooted Augustines’ Convent, in Auxerre, when
he heard of the death of Paladius, fifth apostolic missionary
of the Holy See in the island of Erin. Patrick
solicited and obtained the honour of succeeding him.
He was made Archbishop <i>in partibus infidelium</i>, and
set out with twenty other French priests.</p>

<p>A certain number of Christians were already to be
found in Ireland; but the bulk of the nation remained
attached to its traditional worship, which
was that of Chaldea and of Ancient Gaul, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
worship of the sun or fire, as the principle of all life
and purity.</p>

<p>Yet the sons of Erin were not by any means barbarians;
their civilization could rather be regarded
as the most flourishing in Europe. They knew the
art of weaving stuffs, and of working metals; their
laws were wise and just, their customs hardy without
ferocity. Patrick knew better than any one that he
must think neither of hurrying their conversion nor
of imposing it by force. He devoted himself with
great adroitness to the task of winning the favour
of the chiefs, tenderly handled all the national prejudices,
loudly extolled the excellence of the Brehon
Code, and succeeded at last in giving baptism to the
Princes of Leinster. After this the new religion
made such rapid progress that at the end of fifteen
years Patrick was obliged to ask for thirty new
Bishops from Rome, besides the numerous native
priests who had already received ordination at his
hands. When he died at the ripe age of one hundred
and twenty years, Ireland had become Christian, and
was rapidly being Latinised in the innumerable
schools attached to the monasteries and churches.
She even entered so eagerly in the new path as to
deserve the name of “Isle of Saints” throughout the
Roman world, and that for a long time it was enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
to be Irish or to have visited Erin to become invested
with almost a halo of sanctity.</p>

<p>That transformation had been accomplished without
violence or effusion of blood. Until the 8th
century it was a source of honour and prosperity for
Ireland, for the lustre of her own civilization was
enhanced by her renown for piety, and all the neighbouring
nations sent their sons in flocks to be instructed
in her arts and her virtues.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But the very virtues that made her a country of
monks and scholars were doomed before long to
become the source of all her misfortunes. When the
Scandinavian invasions began to pour over the whole
of Europe, Ireland, emasculated by an entirely
mystical devotion, was found incapable of sustaining
the shock of the Northmen. The disappearance of the
Fenian Militia had for a long time left her without a
national tie, given up to local rivalries, and broken in
pieces, as it were, by the clan system. At the very
time that she most urgently needed a powerful
central authority to struggle against the <i>black</i> and
<i>white strangers</i> from Norway and Denmark, she
was found defenceless, and it was not her feeble belt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
of mountains, opening everywhere on deep bays, that
could oppose a serious barrier to them, or guard her
plains against their invasions.</p>

<p>Pressed by hunger, the Scandinavians left their
country in shoals. They threw themselves on the
coasts of Great Britain, France, and Spain, as far as
the basin of the Mediterranean. In no place were
the people of Europe, already enfeebled by habits of
comparative luxury, able to resist those giants of the
North, who dauntlessly embarked in their otter-skin
boats and dared to go up the Seine even to the very
walls of Paris. Ireland was a prey marked out for
them. If peradventure the invading party were not
numerous enough and were beaten back by numbers,
they would come back in thousands the following
year and sweep all before them. Vainly did the
sons of Erin fight with all the courage of despair;
one after the other their chieftains were vanquished,
and the foe definitely took up a position on the south-east
coast, where he founded the cities of Strangford,
Carlingford, and Wexford.</p>

<p>Not content with reducing the Irish to bondage,
the victors took a cunning and savage delight in
humiliating and degrading them, lodging garnisaries
under their roofs, interdicting, under pain of
death, the exercise of all liberal arts as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
carrying of arms, destroying schools, burning books
to take possession of the gold boxes that protected
their precious binding.</p>

<p>Every ten or twelve years a liberator sprang up in
the West or North, and tried to shake off the abhorred
yoke. But the rebellion only made it weigh more
heavily on the neck of the vanquished; and if it
happened that a Brian Boru succeeded, after incredible
efforts and heroism, in gathering troops numerous
enough to inflict on the stranger a bloody defeat, such
a day of glory was invariably followed by the most
sinister morrow.</p>

<p>After two centuries of slavery, interrupted by massacres,
vain struggles, and impotent efforts, Ireland,
once so prosperous, gradually sank in the darkest
state of barbarism. The intestine dissensions and the
rivalries between clans achieved the work of the
Northern Conquerors. In the year 1172 she was ripe
for new masters, also of Scandinavian race, who were
ready to swoop on her with their Anglo-Saxon bands,
after passing, to come to her, through the duchy of
Normandy and through Great Britain.</p>

<p>Henry the Second of Anjou, King of England, was
resolved to add Ireland to his possessions. All he
wanted was a pretext. He found it in the state of
practical schism and independence into which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
insular Church had fallen. The members of its clergy
no longer recognized the Roman discipline, did not
observe Lent, and married like those of the Greek
rite. Henry the Second solicited and obtained from
Pope Adrian II. a bull authorizing him to invade the
sister isle, in order to “re-establish therein the rule of
the Holy See, stop the progress of vice, bring back
respect for law and religion, and secure the payment
of St. Peter’s pence.” But in spite of this formal
authorization he was too much occupied with Aquitaine
to be able to entertain seriously the idea of
undertaking the conquest of Ireland, when one of his
vassals, Strongbow, cut the knot by landing on the
island at the head of a Welsh army, to carve himself
a kingdom on the south-east coast.</p>

<p>The way was open; Henry II. threw himself in it
in his turn, and established himself in the east of the
island, where, strong in the countenance of the clergy
secured to him by the Papal bull, he received before
long the homage of the principal native chieftains.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Limited at first to a territory enclosed within palisades,
or <i>Pale</i>, which, during more than four centuries,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
enlarged or got narrowed, according to the
fortune of war and the relative strength of the belligerent
parties, the English rule was destined at last to
spread over the whole of the island. But, of this
seven-century struggle, the last word is not yet said.
The wound is ever bleeding. Ireland has never
accepted her defeat; she refuses to accept as valid a
marriage consummated by a rape. Always she protested,
either by direct rebellion, when she found the
opportunity for it, as in 1640, in 1798, and in 1848;
either by the voice of her poets and orators, by the
nocturnal raids of her <i>Whiteboys</i> and <i>Ribbonmen</i>, by the
plots of her Fenians, by the votes of her electors,
by parliamentary obstruction, by passive resistance,
by political or commercial interdict—opposed to the
intruder; in a word, by all the means, legal or illegal,
that offered to interrupt prescription.</p>

<p>A striking, and, one may say, a unique example in
history: after seven centuries of sustained effort on
the part of the victor to achieve his conquest, this
conquest is less advanced than on the morrow of
Henry the Second’s landing at Waterford. An abyss
still severs the two races, and time, instead of filling
up that abyss, only seems to widen it. This phenomenon
is of such exceptional and tragic interest; it
beats with such crude light on the special physiology<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
of two races and the general physiology of humanity,
that one needs must stop first and try to unravel its
tangible causes if one be desirous of comprehending
what is taking place in the land of Erin.</p>

<p>The English, it must be admitted, are no amiable
masters. Never, in any quarter of the globe, were
they able to command the goodwill of the nations
submitted to their rule, nor did they fascinate them by
those brilliant qualities that often go a long way
towards forgiveness of possible injuries. “Take yourself
off there, that I may take your place,” seems
always to have been the last word of their policy.
Pure and simple extermination of autochthon races;
such is their surest way to supremacy. One has seen
it successively in America, on the Australian continent,
in Tasmania, in New Zealand, where the native tribes
hardly exist now more than as a memory. On the
other hand, if the vanquished races were too numerous
or too sturdy and prolific to be easily suppressed,
as in India or Ireland, reconciliation never took place;
conquest ever remained a doubtful and precarious
fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>In Ireland, the question was made more complex
by two elements that visibly took a predominant
part in the relations between the conquerors and the
conquered. In the first place, the island of Erin,
having remained outside the pale of the Roman world
and of barbaric invasions, possessed an indigenous
and original civilization that made her peculiarly refractory
to the establishment of the feudal system.
Secondly, her very remoteness and her insular character
inclined the immigrants to establish themselves
there regretfully, to consider her always as a colony
and a place of exile, where they only resided against
their will. For the first four hundred years of their
occupation they confined themselves to the eastern
coast within the inclosed territory (varying with the
fortune of war) that they called the <i>Pale</i> or palisade,
and outside which the Irish preserved their manners,
their laws, and their own customs.</p>

<p>In spite of this barrier, it happened in the course of
time that the English colonists got pervaded by those
customs and felt their contagion. At once the British
Parliament had recourse to drastic laws in order to
open a new abyss between the two races, and keep
the mastery they had over the Irish. Such is
the special object of an edict of Edward III.,
known under the name of <i>Edict of Kilkenny</i>, and by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
which it is reputed high treason for any Englishman
established in Ireland to have married an Irish-woman,
to have legitimised an Irish child, or have
held him in baptism, to have taken an Irish
Christian name, to have worn the Irish dress, to have
spoken the Erse tongue, to have let his moustache
grow, or to have ridden saddleless, as was the Irish
fashion; above all, to have submitted to the Brehon
Code. Those divers crimes were punished by confiscation
of property, and perpetual imprisonment of the
offender.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Such laws were a powerful obstacle to fusion, raised
by the intruder himself. One sees at once the difference
between, for instance, such a system and that
established by the Norman invasion in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Here the conqueror found a race made supple by
Roman occupation and Danish rule; he established
himself, by strength of arm, on the soil, covered it
with strongholds, and everywhere substituted himself
to the dispossessed masters; he at once implanted
within his new dominions the French tongue, the
feudal system, the powerful hierarchy that constituted
its strength; he remained standing, iron-covered
and in arms, over the prostrate bodies of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
population in bondage, and repressed with such a
high hand any attempt at rebellion, that the very idea
of resistance must of necessity die out soon. On the
other hand, having transplanted himself, and without
any idea of return, in this new sphere, he immediately
submitted to its influence; he incorporated himself
with the ambient race to such a degree as soon to
forget his own origin, and come after two or three
generations to consider himself as purely of English
breed.</p>

<p>In Ireland, on the contrary, not only was the conqueror
reduced by the imperfect state of his conquest
to remain on the defensive, confined within the Pale
on the eastern shore, within reach, so to say, of the
mother country; not only could not he dream for a
long time of obliging populations that escaped all
action on his part to obey his manners and his laws;
not only did he systematically keep those populations
at arm’s length and avoided mixing with them; but
periodical laws and edicts constantly came to remind
them, on pain of terrible punishment, that he belonged
to another race, and must guard with jealous care the
integrity of its autonomy. Without any intercourse
with the more distant tribes, he was at constant war
with those of the borders of the Pale.</p>

<p>And war was, at this period even still more than in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
our own days, mere rapine, raised to the dignity of a
system. The English did not scruple to make incursions
on their neighbour’s lands, to take away harvest,
cattle, and women, after which they returned to their
fortified territory.</p>

<p>They did even worse: having heard of the ancient
custom by which the Irish formerly accorded fire and
candle light to their national militia or Fenians, the
English revived it to their own profit; they quartered
on the peasantry in their neighbourhood during all
the winter, a soldier, who took his seat round the
domestic hearth, shared the meals of the family, took
possession of the best bed—nay, did not disdain to
cast the eye of favour on the wife or daughter—and
not the less remained a stranger, a foe, at the same
time that he was a forced guest and a spy—for he
was forbidden to speak the language, to adopt the
dress, to imitate the manners of his victims.... The
horror of that burden coming anew every year
had once led to the suppression of the Fenian militia.
How much more terrible was such servitude, enforced
by the enemy! Constant were the rebellions, and
always repressed with calculated barbarity—they only
served as a pretext for new exactions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Still, in spite of all, a certain contagion of habits
took place between the contiguous races. A few
native chiefs insensibly began to imitate the manners
of the English. The English were not long in discovering
a way to reconcile them—by appealing to
their basest impulses.</p>

<p>Until then, the Irish had had no knowledge of
individual property. With them land was, like the
sky or the air they breathed, the common inheritance
of those who occupied it. The members of a clan,
indeed, paid the chieftain a tax or annual duty, but
they did not conceive it as possible that this leader
could look on himself as the master of the social fund
to which they, like him, had a hereditary right. At
the most they expected their harvest or cattle to
be seized, in case of non-payment of the tax.
There never had been an eviction of the tenant,
as there had been no sale or transfer of the
land by him occupied. Individual appropriation,
as resulting from the feudal system, was such a
new idea to the Irish that they were at first unable to
grasp it.</p>

<p>“What interest can you have in making your clan
give up their land to the English, since you get it
back in return for your homage?” would ask some
of the native chieftains of those of their countrymen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
nearer the pale who had taken for some time to
performing that commercial transaction.</p>

<p>The neophytes of feudal law would then explain
that in case of extension of the English conquest,
their possession of the land would be guaranteed by
the fact of the new title. What they took great care
should not be discovered by the clan, was that they
gave what did not belong to them, and sold the
collective property of their followers, to receive it
afterwards at the hands of the English as personal
property.... This was seen clearly later on,
when they began to sell it or raise mortgages on it.
But that, the dawn of a gigantic fraud, nobody in
Ireland could so much as suspect. The fraudulent
origin of individual appropriation is nevertheless,
even to our own day, the true root of the desperate
resistance that the Irish tenant invariably opposes to
eviction. Be it tradition, be it “cellular memory,” he
is conscious of his primordial and superior right to
that glebe once stolen from his forefathers.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Stolen! if only it had been stolen once for all!...
But to repeat Fitzgibbon’s (Lord Clare) saying,
there is not in the whole of Ireland one field that
has not been <i>at least three times</i> unjustly taken from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
its legitimate possessors. And that spoliation was
always accompanied by the most aggravating circumstances.</p>

<p>It was indeed with Henry VIII. and Elizabeth that
the true efforts of England to achieve the conquest of
Erin were made, and from that time, to the antagonism
of the two races, to the conflict of interests, was added
religious hatred. Between puritanical England and
Catholic Ireland began a duel to the death, into which
each generation in turn has thrown itself for three
centuries. Oppression begets rebellion, and rebellion
expires drowned in blood. We have no intention of
repeating that history in these pages; its details are
to be found everywhere. Let us only recall its essential
features.</p>

<p>Towards the year 1565, Queen Elizabeth undertook
the “plantation” of Ireland on a large scale, and
set about it by the elementary process of dispossessing
the owners of the soil in order to present
Englishmen with their lands. The whole country
rose, under the command of John Desmond, who
called the Spaniards to his aid. Upon which England
sent to Ireland, together with Sydney, Sussex, and
Walter Raleigh, armies whose instructions were “the
extermination of the Rebels.”</p>

<p>“At Christmas,” wrote one of the English Generals,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
Sir Nicolas Malby, in the year 1576, “I entered
Connaught, and soon finding that by mercy I should
only succeed in having my throat cut, I preferred to
adopt a different tactic. I therefore threw myself in
the mountains with the settled determination of
destroying these people by sword and fire, sparing
neither the old nor the children. <i>I burnt down all
their harvests and all their houses, and I put to the
sword all that fell within my hands....</i> This
occurred in the country of Shane Burke. I did the
same thing in that of Ullick Burke.”</p>

<p>The other English Generals vied in ardour with
this butcher; so much so that at the end of a few
years of indiscriminate hangings, massacres, burnings
of house and land, the whole of Munster was laid
waste like a desert; a few wretches only were left to
wander over it like ghosts, and they came voluntarily to
offer their throat to the knife of Queen Elizabeth’s
soldiers. The Virgin Queen then resolved to repeople
that desert; she made proclamation that all the lands of
the Desmonds were confiscated (more than 500,000
acres) and she offered them gratuitously to whosoever
would “plant” them with the help of English labour.
The grantees were to pay no duty to the Crown until
six years had passed, and that duty was always to be of
the lightest. In spite of these advantages colonization<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
did not make much progress. The English at last
understood that they must either give it up, or resign
themselves to having the ground cultivated by the
despoiled Irish who had survived the massacres.
H ow could those wretched people have done otherwise
than nourish the hope of revenge?</p>

<p>That revenge was attempted in Ulster at the death
of Elizabeth. It ended in new disasters, new tortures,
new confiscations. The counties of Tyrone, Derry,
Donegal, Armagh, Fermanagh, and Cavan,—in all
about three million acres,—were then seized by the
Crown and distributed in lots to Scotch settlers.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the year 1641, under the reign of Charles I., a
few Irishmen having emigrated to the continent, and
having been initiated to modern military tactics in
the ranks of the French army, attempted to liberate
their country. They provoked a rising, succeeded in
holding in check during eight years all the British
forces, and in 1649 compelled the King of England to
grant them by formal treaty the conditions they
themselves dictated. But a few days later the head
of Charles fell on the scaffold, and Cromwell in
person, escorted by his son, by Ireton and Ludlow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
made it his business to come and annul the treaty of
Kilkenny.</p>

<p>“For Jesus!... No quarter!...” Such was
the battle-cry he gave to his Roundheads. Drogheda,
then Wexford were taken by storm; men, women,
and children were exterminated; Galway fell in
1652. The populations, exhausted by a war and
famine of ten years’ duration, surrendered themselves
to his mercy, and laid down their arms. Cromwell
had only now to reap the fruits of his victory by
making Ireland pay for it.</p>

<p>His first idea was to complete the extermination of
the native race, in order to replace it by English colonists.
But even his gloomy soul recoiled before the
only means that at once and for ever could put an end
to “the Irish gangrene.” He adopted a middle course,
of much less radical efficacy. This middle course consisted
in transporting, or, as they called it at the time
<i>transplanting</i> all the Irish into the region bounded by
the Shannon, there to be penned up like men infested
with the plague, while all the rest of the territory was
allotted to English families.</p>

<p>The enterprise was conducted with truly puritanical
method and rigour. Thousands of Irish were shipped
as slaves to the West Indies, thousands of others were
imprisoned in Connaught, under pain of death for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
whoever should cross its limits. All the land, carefully
parcelled out, was divided by lot between the
soldiers of Cromwell, upon agreement that they should
consider themselves bound to expend their pay for
three years on the improvement of it. But those fields,
to yield up their value, had to be cultivated, and the
English labourer declined to become a voluntary exile
in order to cultivate them. Little by little the native
peasantry came back to their old homes with the
tenacity peculiar to their class, they founded families
and reconstituted the Irish nation under the ten or
twelve thousand landlords imposed over them by fraud
and violence. Forty years after Cromwell’s death,
these landlords had even forgotten how to speak the
English language.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Restoration was not destined to heal any of those
cruel wounds. Charles II. took little heed of Ireland,
which he deemed too far off, and besides he thought it
good policy not to disturb the new occupants in their
possessions. He barely deemed it necessary to
establish in Dublin a Court of Revision that sat only
one year, examined no more than seven hundred cases<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
out of a total of above three thousand that were submitted
to it, and ordered the restitution of hardly a
sixth part of the confiscated land.</p>

<p>After the Revolution of 1688, nevertheless, the
Irish only embraced with more ardour the cause of
James II. when he landed in Ireland with a handful
of men. Even after his defeat at the Boyne, they so
successfully resisted William of Orange that he was
compelled in 1691 to grant to them, by the treaty of
Limerick, the free exercise of their religion and the
political privileges that could help them to preserve
it. But, like so many other charters, that one was
soon to be violated. All the Irish Jacobites were
compelled to expatriate themselves (numbers of them
took service in France; more than fifty thousand
Irishmen died under the <i>fleur-de-lis</i> during the
first half of the eighteenth century); four thousand
others were evicted from one million of acres that
William distributed among his followers. Soon to
this already terrible repression were to be added
all the rigours of the Penal Code, that code that proclaimed
it a duty to spy, and a meritorious act to
betray the Irishman at his hearth; that code of
which Burke could say: “Never did the ingenious
perversity of man put forth a machine more perfect,
more thoughtfully elaborated, more calculated to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
oppress, to impoverish, to degrade a people, to lower
in them human nature itself.”</p>

<p>Under the network of that nameless despotism
which attacked man in his dearest privileges, the
rights of conscience, the sanctity of home,—under
the weight of a legislation that in a manner forbade
her the use of water and fire, that closed all careers
before her, after having wrenched her last furrow from
her keeping,—the Irish nation persisted in living
and multiplying. Was it any wonder that in the
depth of her collective soul she cherished dreams of
revenge and justice?</p>

<p>The American Emancipation and the French Revolution
appeared to her as the dawn of regeneration.
Alas! once again the glorious effort of 1798,—the
rebellion in arms, victory itself, were only to end in a
complete wreck. As if Fate owed one more stroke of
irony to this martyred nation, it was an Irish Parliament
that by its own vote in 1800 abdicated the
hardly recovered national independence. Pitt bought
it wholesale for the price of 1,200,000 guineas.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was not enough, however, to have taken from
the Irishman his blood, his land, his religious faith,
and his liberty: they must still prevent his prospering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
in commerce or industry. Political interest was here
in accordance with avarice in giving this advice to
the victor.</p>

<p>Charles II. began by forbidding Ireland to export
meat, butter, and cheese to England. At that time
of slow maritime intercourse, no idea could be
entertained of sending them to any other market.
The Irish had to fall back on wool, which they exported
to France and Spain. That was sufficient to
arouse the jealousy of their pitiless masters. The
export of wool, be it as raw material or in woven
stuffs, was forbidden the Irish on pain of confiscation
and fines.</p>

<p>The effect of this harsh measure was two-fold: it
prevented the abhorred Irish prospering; it secured
to the English merchant the monopoly of Irish wool,
which he could henceforth buy at his own price
(generally at a quarter of the current price), and sell
again at a lesser rate than all his competitors. It
only remained for Ireland to make smugglers of all
her fishermen; they crammed all the caverns on her
coasts with wool, and during the winter, in spite of
excisemen, they exchanged it for the wines and
spirits of France and Spain. By the same occasion
they exported soldiers and imported Catholic priests.
Thus did Ireland keep losing her vital strength, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
the constant departure of the most vigorous amongst
her sons, at the same time that she inoculated in
her blood two equally fatal poisons—alcohol and
fanaticism.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Puritan weavers of Ulster
were ruined like the wool-farmers. They emigrated
to America, and England found no bitterer foes
than their sons during the War of Independence.</p>

<p>Some of the Irish tried to fall back on other industries,
as the weaving of linen or ship-building. At
once England interfered with an iron hand by establishing
the most ruinous prohibitive duties on Irish
linens, while at the same time her cotton fabrics came
pouring over the country. To make doubly sure,
England, by a special law, formally interdicted ship-building
in Ireland as well as any direct trade with
any foreign market whatsoever.</p>

<p>One feels a sort of shame for the human kind in
having to record such consistent acts of systematic
cruelty. The violence of military retaliation, the
sacking of towns or the massacre of vanquished foes,
may be explained by the heat of combat, and are
found in the annals of all countries. An economical
compression exercised during ten or twelve generations
on one nation by another nation of Shylocks is,
happily, a fact without any parallel in history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>From the beginning of the 18th century all
industrial enterprise had thus been unmercifully
forbidden to Ireland. All the factories were closed,
the working population had been reduced to field
labour, emigration or street-begging. This population
therefore weighed still more heavily on the soil,
still exaggerating its tendencies to subdivision;
which tendencies, already a curse for Ireland, were
to cause in the future new ferments of hatred
and misery. All the attempts that Ireland made to
free herself from those iron shackles were pitilessly
repressed. She saw herself deprived of her right to
commercial activity, as she had been of national
conscience, of land, and religious or political freedom.
And it is after having thus for centuries systematically
trained the Irish to poverty, idleness, and
drink, that England, crowning her work with calumny,
dares to bring forward their vices as an excuse for
herself!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>These things are far from us already. But it would
be erring greatly to imagine that in the eyes of the
Irish they bear an antiquated character. Oral tradition,
seconded by an indigenous literature, keeps
the wound open and green. Yonder wretched beggar,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
dying of hunger and want upon the glebe once possessed
by his ancestors, knows that they ruled where
he now serves, bears their name with a touching
pride, and sadly toils for others in a field that he
believes to belong to himself. He is not ignorant of
the way in which it was taken from him, at what date,
and in what manner the event took place. How
could he consider its present possessors otherwise
than as his most cruel enemies?</p>

<p>Let us imagine the French <i>émigrés</i> brought back
violently on the lands taken from them by the nation,
and reduced to support their family by tilling their
fields with their own hands. Let us suppose them
compelled every year to pay an exorbitant rent to
the usurper. Let us blot out from history’s page
the milliard indemnity given to the <i>émigrés</i> and the
amnesty passed over those things by five or six successive
revolutions. Let us lastly add to these deadly
rancours the weight of a religious persecution of three
centuries, of the undisguised contempt of the victor,
and of the most shocking political inequality....
Let that <i>émigré</i>, in a word, not only have lost caste,
be spoliated and a serf, but also be a pariah, a kind of
pestilent member of the community: then we shall
gather some idea of the state of mind of the Irish
people towards England; we shall understand that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
in truth the only mistake committed by Cromwell
and the others in their system of colonization was
to have not carried it to its full length, to have not
exterminated all by fire or sword, and to have left
a single son of Erin alive.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As a contrast to England and Ireland, let us place
a historical fact of the same order, that of France
with Corsica. Here also we find an insular race of
markedly distinct character, of different language,
different manners and traditions, the habit of independence
and the clan-spirit,—all that can foster
and serve resistance to annexation. But here the
conquering nation is France, and she is a kind
mother. She does not come, fire and sword in hand,
to ravage the harvests of the vanquished, to take his
land, to impose on him, together with a new faith,
exceptional laws, and a brand of infamy. On the
contrary, to them she opens her arms, she offers her
wealth and her love. From the first day she admits
Corsicans to the provincial parliaments, and twenty
years later she receives their deputies in the
Assemblée Nationale. From the first hour they
feel they are Frenchmen, the equals of those born
in the Ile de France. There are for them neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
special taxes, nor political inferiority, nor rigours of
any sort. Never was an inch of ground taken from
them to be given to the continental families. Never
were they treated like serfs to be trodden down
without mercy. If there be an exception made, it
is in their favour; as, for instance, the reduction of
one half of all duties on imports; the free trade in
tobacco; the enormous proportion of Corsicans
admitted to all Government offices.</p>

<p>But what a difference, too, in the results!... In
less than a hundred years, the fusion between the
two races is so perfect, the assimilation so complete,
that one could not find to-day one man in Corsica
to wish for a separation. Nay, rather, against such
an enterprise, if any one were found to attempt it, all
Corsica would rise in arms.</p>

<p>If Great Britain had so willed it, Ireland might
easily have become to her what Corsica is to us.
Only, for the last seven hundred years, Great Britain
has lacked what alone could have made that miracle
possible,—a mother’s heart and love.</p>

<p>I know no place to compare with Killarney: so
soft to the eye, so full of unspeakable grace. It is
as a compendium of Ireland; all the characteristic
features of the country are united there: the elegant
“round towers,” drawing on the horizon the airy
outline of their conic shafts; the soft moistness of the
atmosphere, the tender blue of the sky, the intense
green of the meadows, set off by long, black trails of
peat, and the white, ochre, and red streaks which the
grit-stone and clay-slate draw on the hill-side.</p>

<p>Within the oval circus formed by the mountains of
Kerry, the Killarney lakes succeed one another like
small Mediterraneans, all dotted with lovely islands,
where myrtle and rare ferns grow freely, fostered by a
Lusitanian climate. Every one of those islands has
its legend, its own saint, buried under some old moss-grown
mound; its ruined castle, its ivy-clothed
abbey, paved with tombstones and haunted by some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
<i>banshee</i>. They are like large baskets of flowers
floating on the clear, silent waters, whose peace is
only broken now and then by the jumping of a fish,
or the clucking of some stray teal. All there unite
to form a landscape of almost paradoxical beauty.
You think you have landed in fairyland, outside the
pale of ordinary life.</p>

<p>The most illustrious of them is Innisfallen, where
the monks wrote in the seventh century their famous
<i>Annals</i>, the pride of the Bodleian Library. In viewing
this enchanting island, you involuntarily fall to

<p>Along the shores of that range of lakes, two lordly
domains display the noble arrangement of their parks:
one is the seat of the Earl of Kenmare, lord-lieutenant
of the county, late Lord Chamberlain to the Queen
during the Gladstone Ministry. The other belongs
to Captain Herbert of Muckross, late Member of
Parliament. As far around as you can see the land<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
belongs to either of those two landlords. Just as in
the tale, down to the extremity of the valley, up to
the very top of the far-away mountain, land and
water, beasts and Christians, all belong to the “Marquis
de Carabas.”</p>

<p>Some restriction must be made, however. Changes
have been introduced lately. Only a few years ago
it was a thing understood that of the two members
which the borough returned to Parliament one must
be the heir presumptive of the house of Kenmare, the
other the chief of the house of Muckross. That is
over. Now-a-days the Kerry voters send whom Mr.
Parnell likes to the House of Commons. But the air
of the parks is still the property of the two owners;
none may breathe it without their leave. I hasten to
say that the permission is most courteously given by
Lord Kenmare to all tourists, and as readily (if less
liberally) sold on the Muckross grounds to anyone
willing to pay one or two shillings, according to his
approach walking or on horseback.</p>

<p>The two parks are marvels, almost without other
rivals in the world, for their prodigious extent, their
admirably kept shrubberies and avenues, and the
splendour and variety of the points of view which
art has devised on the lakes. Those lakes themselves,
with their islands, bays, and toy-peninsulas, their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
rippling brooks and foaming cascades, are only part
of the beauties of the whole. Muckross is proud to
possess the old abbey of the same name, and the
Torc Cascade. Kenmare boasts Innisfallen, Ross
Island, Saint Finian’s Tomb, the legendary ruins of
O’Donoghue’s Castle, and a hundred other wonders.
It is more regal than lordly, and there are indeed few
royal residences which can boast such gardens.</p>

<p>You go away dazzled, enchanted, intoxicated with
verdure, ozone, and poetic sights. You come back
the day following, you almost wish to take root there
for a sort of contemplative life, where you would discard
any heavier occupation than catching salmon,
smoking endless cigarettes, and reading over your
favourite authors. A rich artist, it is said, being
pricked with a violent desire of that kind, offered I
don’t know how much ready money to Lord Kenmare
if he would grant him five hundred square yards of
ground on Ross Island. The offer was declined.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There is a reverse side to the picture; and it could
scarcely be less brilliant. Killarney is a sorry borough
of about four or five thousand inhabitants, more
miserable looking than words can express. Except
in the great hotels which English enterprise has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
raised for fleecing the tourists attracted there by the
beauty of the lakes, there is not a vestige of ease or
prosperity. No busy workman, not one manufacture
is to be seen. The miserable shops exhibit a few
dusty wares which nobody seems anxious either to
buy or to sell. There is a despondent stillness about,
and people look tired with doing nothing. The
women, all more or less “tattered and torn,” wear a
poor rag of a shawl on their heads. Half-naked
children, wild-haired, full of vermin, swarm out of all
the small alleys which open on the one street of the
town. Only the Anglican and Catholic churches rise
above the sordid little dwellings with a substantial
and well-to-do air.</p>

<p>Go out of the village, follow the long walls which
enclose the lordly seats, and after three or four miles
you will find again the Irish country such as you have
seen it everywhere. Turnip and barley fields, thin
pastures, few trees or none at all. On the road-side
occasionally is a consumptive cow, or a pig wallowing in
mud fraternally with two or three bright-eyed urchins.
Here and there a hovel with the traditional dung-hill
and three hens. Nothing, in short, calculated to bring
a new light on the agrarian crisis.</p>

<p>It is in Kerry, however, that the malady has reached
its most acute state, they all tell me. But you could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
not believe how hard it is to obtain any definite information
about those matters. People who really know
about it feel a sort of shame to bare their national
wounds before a stranger, and besides, the diversity
of judgments makes it difficult to draw something
positive from them. Every man has his party feeling,
and is wishing to enforce it upon you. Provided with
a good number of letters of introduction, and everywhere
received with perfect cordiality, I have talked
already with people of all conditions—landlords,
agents, farmers, doctors, priests, and labourers,—without
having obtained as yet any but individual views.
Home Rulers and Orangemen have made me hear
arguments that I know by heart from having heard
them repeated these last eight years, ever since the
crisis entered its actual phase. This is not the thing
we want: we want <i>espèces</i>, as they say in French law;
specific illustration, direct symptoms of the Irish
disease.</p>

<p>And that is the difficulty. The habit of living
among certain deformities so familiarises us with
them that we are no longer able to perceive them,
and still less to point them out. Moreover, when
upon receiving a letter from London, a man is
kind enough to ask you to dinner, to introduce you
to his wife and daughters, to lend you his horse and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
trap, and to empty for your benefit his store of ready-made
opinions, is it possible decently to ask him
more? He has his own affairs, and cannot spend his
time running with you through hill and dale in order
to help you to unravel a sociological problem.</p>

<p>By a stroke of good luck I met the scout I wanted.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I was returning from an excursion to the Gap of
Dunloe when, on the banks of the river which waters
the Kenmare estate, near the bridge, I noticed a man of
about forty, of middle height, poorly but neatly clad,
who was walking in front of me and gave evident signs
of wishing to enter into conversation. I had been so
harassed lately by the swarm of cicerones and incompetent
guides who crowd all ways to the lakes
and sights around Killarney, that I had grown
suspicious, and pretended not to see the man. But
he had his idea and stuck to it. Slackening his pace,
he began to whistle <i>La Marseillaise</i>.</p>

<p>That was saying plainly:—</p>

<p>“You are French, and I am a friend of France like
all Irishmen. You are welcome here.”</p>

<p>Throughout the world it is the adopted form for
such a declaration of love. On board a transatlantic
steamer or in the sitting-rooms of a cosmopolite hotel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
when a fair-haired or dark-haired new acquaintance
seats herself to the piano and begins to play the
march of Rouget de l’Isle, the French tourist can see
his way: he is looked upon with no unfriendly eye.</p>

<p>There were no dark or fair tresses here, but only a
bearded pepper-and-salt quadragenarian, with the
patent purpose of hooking me at the rate of half-a-crown
an hour: so I remained obdurate. But he,
suddenly making up his mind:—</p>

<p>“Well, <i>Sor</i>,” he said to me with a soft voice and
the most enticing smile, “how do you <i>loike</i> our
country?”</p>

<p>“Your country? I should like it a great deal
better if one could go about it without being pestered
by guides at every turning,” I said, but half-remorsefully.</p>

<p>“How true, sir! Those guides positively infest the
place. And if they only knew their trade! But they
are regular swindlers, beggars who steal the tourist’s
money; the shame of Ireland, that is what they
are!”</p>

<p>The conversation then commenced, and to say the
truth I have no reason to repent it. The fellow is
well-informed, quick-witted, incredibly talkative, and
in five minutes has given me really valuable information,
besides biographical details about himself. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
is called MacMahon like many others in this country,
for I have seen that name over twenty village shops
already. Is he any relation to the Maréchal? No;
he makes no pretension to that. But after all it is
not improbable that they come from one root, for my
friend is not, of course, without his relationship with
some of the numberless kings of Ireland.</p>

<p>“And the Marshal is a great man, a brave soldier,
a true Irishman. I have his picture at home. I’ll
show it to you if you do me the honour to visit my
humble roof, and accept a glass of ‘mountain dew.’”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>My new acquaintance has been quill-driver at a
land surveyor’s, and he knows many things. This,
for instance: that all people here, from the most insignificant
farmer to the biggest landowner, are in debt.</p>

<p>“All that glitters is not gold,” he says, with a
melancholy smile. “Do you see that large expanse
of land, sir? Well, those who own it are not perhaps
richer than I, and have not perhaps always
as much pocket-money as would be convenient
for them. Their annual income goes to pay the
interest of an enormous debt, the hereditary obligations
which weigh on the property, and the normal
keeping of it. Mr. Herbert, the owner of Muckross,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
had to emigrate to America, where he is now an
attorney’s clerk, for his daily bread. The shilling
you give for entering his park goes to the scraping of
it. As for Lord Kenmare, he never sees as much as
the tenth part of the revenue of his property, let
alone his being forbidden his own grounds under
pain of being shot dead! Lady Kenmare lives there
alone with her children under protection of a detachment
of the police.” So the masters of those two
noble estates are exiled from them, one by mortgage,
the other by agrarian hatred. O, irony of things!</p>

<p>“But Lord Kenmare’s not a bad landlord, is he?”
I said to MacMahon.</p>

<p>“Far from it. His tenants are eight hundred in
number, and there are not three evicted in the year.
I know personally twenty of them who owe him four
years’ rent and are never troubled about it. But he
has taken position against the League—that is
enough. And then, don’t you know, sir, the best of
landlords is not worth much in the eyes of his tenants.
<i>They want the land and they will have it.</i> But this is
my house. Please come in, sir.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Thus chattering, the communicative Celt had
brought me to the entrance of a small low house<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
in a by-street of Killarney. We entered a sort
of kitchen-parlour on a level with the lane. No
carpet or flooring of any kind but the simple beaten
clay, a large old-fashioned chimney, a table, a few
straw-covered chairs; on the walls a whole private
museum in chromo-lithography: Pope Pius IX., the
Marshal Duke of Magenta, Mr. Parnell, &amp;c., and a
branch of holy palm.</p>

<p>Upon our coming, a poor creature, pale and
emaciated, had risen without showing any surprise.</p>

<p>“Mrs. MacMahon, <i>Sor</i>! Everilda Matilda, a
French gentleman who honours our house by
stopping a moment in it. Call the children, my
dear; the gentleman will be pleased to see them, I
think.”</p>

<p>A tall girl with brown eyes first presents herself,
then a boy between twelve and thirteen years old,
then a variety of younger fry. I am told that Mary
has passed successfully her “standards,” that Tim
has just begun Latin with an ultimate view to become
a priest “like his uncle Jack;” then the “mountain
dew” is produced. It is a kind of home-made
whisky, not unpalatable.</p>

<p>At last mine host turns to his wife.</p>

<p>“Supposing, my dear, you show your lace to the
French gentleman, to let him see what you can do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
when you are not bed-ridden. Perhaps he will like
to bring back some little remembrance of Killarney
to his ‘lady.’”</p>

<p>I was caught.</p>

<p>Everilda Matilda instantly produced a box containing
cuffs and collars of Irish point, and all that
remains to me to do, if I am not ready to forfeit my
rights to the qualification of gentleman, is to buy a
few guineas’ worth. Hardly is the matter over, than
MacMahon turns to the future ecclesiastic—</p>

<p>“And you, Tim, will you not show the gentleman
those sticks you polish so well?”</p>

<p>Caught again!</p>

<p>If each member of the family has his own private
trade, the <i>mountain-dew</i> threatens to be rather an
expensive refreshment.</p>

<p>“I am greatly obliged to you,” I said, “but I have
got already a complete collection of <i>shillelaghs</i>.”</p>

<p>MacMahon’s jaw fell visibly.</p>

<p>“But we could perhaps make another arrangement,
that would be more advantageous,” I continued
quietly. “You know the country well, you tell me?”</p>

<p>“As a man who has lived forty years in it and
never left it.”</p>

<p>“Well, let us have a pair of good hacks; you lead
me for a couple of days across field and country, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
show me a dozen authentic cases of eviction, agrarian
violence, or boycottism. If you will undertake this,
and I am satisfied with you, upon our return I will
take the whole lot of lace.”</p>

<p>You should have seen the glowing faces of the
whole family! The affair was soon settled, and the
day after we started.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<span class="smaller">THROUGH KERRY ON HORSEBACK.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>It was not two days but six that we spent, my
guide and I, visiting the County Kerry in all directions,
examining the crops, asking about prices, entering
cottages and small farms, chatting with anyone
that we supposed capable of giving us information.
The rather unexpected conclusion I arrived at was
that the agrarian crisis is more especially felt in the
richest districts, while it can hardly be said to exist in
the poorest parts. Kerry is, in that particular, a true
copy of Ireland on a small scale. It may, in fact, be
divided into two perfectly distinct regions—the plains
of the north and the mountains of the south-west.
Those regions offer characteristics as marked in an
economical as in a geographical point of view.</p>

<p>Another conclusion drawn from my personal intercourse
with the Irish peasant was that nothing is to
be got out of him by bullying and everything by
gentle means. If you arrive at an inn and proceed, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
do the English everywhere, to assume a harsh and
arrogant tone, you will experience the greatest difficulties
in obtaining even meagre fare in return for
your money. They will pretend they have nothing
in the house, that they are not in the habit of receiving
travellers, and such like stories. If, on the contrary,
you at once proclaim yourself delighted with the
country, its manners and its inhabitants; if you risk
a compliment to the hostess or a gentle pinch to the
children’s cheek, the whole house is yours. They will
instantly wring the neck of the solitary chicken promenading
in front of the house; they will exhibit
clean table-linen; they will rush to the neighbour
and borrow a salad or some fruit; they will even
unearth from some dark corner a bottle of old port.
If you give this impromptu supper only half the
praise it deserves, you may count on a luxurious
breakfast for the next morning. These poor people
are thus made. Their heart is warm; their sensibilities
are quick. The least thing discourages them;
the least thing electrifies them. In contradiction to the
Anglo-Saxon serf, who despises his master if he treat
him with gentleness, Paddy prefers a gracious word
to all the guineas in the kingdom. The philosophical
reason for the failure of the British in Ireland (and
elsewhere) is perhaps chiefly to be found in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
general want of human sympathy. The Englishman
speaks too often like a slave-driver when he should
speak like an elder brother.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">The Plain.</span></p>

<p>The plains of North Kerry must be classed among
the best land in the isle. This is not saying that they
are first-class. But they evidently only need some
outlay in drainage and manure and a few modern
improvements in culture to rival our Normandy
pastures. It is above all a land of grazing fields
and butter; the grass in the meadows is green and
luxuriant; the cows look strong and well. It is
evident that the least effort would be sufficient to
make agricultural enterprise a thriving business. But
carelessness and want of thrift are plainly shown on
all sides. Everywhere dung hills, placed just in front
of the cottage doors, pour into the ditch the clearest
of their virtue. The gardens are ill-kept, the fields
transformed into bog for want of a drain seventy
feet long. One sees oats so invaded by thistles that it
must be a sheer impossibility to get the grain out.
In other fields oats rot standing, because no one
takes care to cut them in time. Nowhere is any sign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
shown of vigorous enterprise or activity. Not only
do routine and sloth reign all over the country, but
one might be tempted to believe in a general conspiracy
for wasting the gratuitous gifts of Mother
Nature without any profit to anybody.</p>

<p>Yet the country looks relatively rich. The peasantry
have good clothes, they despise potatoes, eat bread
and meat, drink beer or tea, send their children to
school, and appear peculiarly wide awake to their
own interests. Are they really, as they declare,
unable to pay their rents? That is possible, for the
principal products of the country—corn, oats, barley,
butter, beef, and mutton, wool and potatoes—have
undergone for the last three years a considerable
depreciation, estimated at from 15 to 35 per cent.
But this depreciation is evidently not felt by a diminution
of comfort for the rural populations, here at least.
The contrary might even be admitted. In any case
there is evidently no question of a crisis of famine
such as has so often been seen in this island for the
last fifty years. The malady is something else. It
is the malady of a people to whom it has been
repeated for half a century that the land they live
on has been stolen from them by strangers; a people
who rightly or wrongly believe this to be the case; a
people who have entered, under the direction of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
central committee of politicians, on a regular struggle
with the landlords; who profit by all economical
incidents, especially the fall of prices, if not openly to
denounce the treaty, at least to refuse to execute its
articles.</p>

<p>A few facts noted in passing will explain the situation
better than all discourses.</p>

<p>A large dairy farm, the finest I have yet seen in
the country. The buildings are new, the fields covered
with thick dark grass. I number sixty-five cows.
All the dairy appointments are handsome and well-kept.
The farmer looks prosperous. Clearly he lives
at ease, judging by the furniture of the house, the
quality of his clothes, by the very liberality with
which he receives us, and by the brandy which he
offers us (he is a friend of my guide). His rent is
£100 a year. He does not mean to pay his next
term. (<i>I don’t think I will pay this gale.</i>) His landlord
offers to him the sale of his land for a sum of
eighteen years’ rent, according to the official plan.
If he followed that system all he would have to do
would be to pay annually during forty-nine years the
sum of £78, less by nearly a third than the present
farm rent; he would then become a proprietor. He
refuses. Why?</p>

<p>“Indeed?” he says, with a wink, “engage myself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
for forty-nine years!... <i>Why! I shall have the land
for nothing in two or three years!</i>...”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Another well-to-do farmer driving in a dog-cart
with his two daughters. The trap is new, the harness
smart, the horse strong and well groomed. The
damsels wear Dublin hats and white woollen dresses
not unfashionable in cut.</p>

<p>“That’s what enrages the landlords,” my guide
says to me; “it is to see tenants come in this style
to the Tralee races, cheerfully lose twenty guineas
upon a horse, then, when the time for paying the rent
arrives, coolly ask for a 40 per cent. reduction on their
half-year’s rent....”</p>

<p>“... And in fact it must be enough to make a
saint swear!...” he adds philosophically. “But after
all, the landlords might be content with the 60 per
cent. they get ... I am sure they get it cheap
enough ... they may think themselves lucky to
have even that much, as the interest of confiscated
land!...”</p>

<p>That notion of the land being held by its actual
detentors through confiscation, may be unfounded in
some cases, or even in the majority of cases, but
none the less one finds it at the bottom of all Irish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
syllogisms. And in such cases the real value of
the premiss is of little importance; what matters
only is the conclusion drawn from it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A few middling and small farmers.</p>

<p><i>Maurice Macnamara</i>, Shinnagh: rent, £48 a year;
seventeen cows, eight pigs, two horses and one donkey;
grass fields, oats, and potatoes; four children, of which
one is over twenty years of age. Was able to pay his
rent, but was forbidden to do so by the other tenants
on the estate, and was in consequence seized by order
of the landlord. His neighbours offered to help him
to resist the execution. He begged to be left alone,
and the moment of the sale having come, he personally
bought all his cattle up to the sum due. Nett result
of the operation: £11 to pay, over and above the six
months’ rent. Personal opinion of Maurice Macnamara:
it is better to pay £11 than to get a bullet
through your head.</p>

<p><i>John McCarthy</i>, Gwingullier: £16 annual rent,
due in May and November; two cows, one horse;
oats and potatoes; nine children, the eldest
seventeen. Has paid nothing to his landlord since
1883; owes actually £48 to him, and as much to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
divers tradespeople or usurers. Does not know how
he shall get out of it.</p>

<p><i>Patrick Murphy</i>, Colyherbeer, barony Trughanarkny;
was evicted in November from his holding
of £28; owed eighteen months’ rent. Received
from his Landlord the offer of being reinstated in the
farm on payment of half the sum due, on condition
that he would let his crops be sold. Declined the
offer, and is perfectly satisfied to receive from the
League relief to the amount of £2 a-week. Never
saw himself so well off before.</p>

<p><i>Margaret Callaghan</i>, a widow, close by the town
of Kenmare: £8 16<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> rent; one pig, six hens;
three small children; four acres of potatoes, three
acres waste. Has paid nothing for the last four
years. Owes about £20 to various tradespeople.
Is not harshly pressed by her landlord, and can
practically be considered as owning her bit of
ground. Will die of hunger, with her children, the
first year the harvest is bad.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Molahiffe, on the road to Tralee.</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Curtin’s house.”</p>

<p>“And who may Mr. Curtin be?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>“What! have you never heard of that affair?...
He was killed last year by the Moonlighters.”</p>

<p>“Killed?... Was he then a party man, a fierce
Orangeman?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Curtin?... Not a bit in the world. He
was one of the most peaceable, the most Irish at
heart, the most esteemed man in this part of the
country. His misfortune was to own two rifles.
The Moonlighters wanted those weapons. One
night they came and demanded them. The ladies
of the family were ready to give them up, when
Mr. Curtin arrived and looked as if he were going
to resist. At once a gun exploded in the passage,
and he fell stone dead.... That was a warning to
everybody. Since that time no one disobeys the
moonlighters. But all the same it is unfortunate
that the victim should have been Mr. Curtin.”</p>

<p>These <i>Moonlighters</i> are the direct descendants of the
Whiteboys of olden times. They band together and
gather at night for the purpose of invading a farm,
a solitary house. They are always masked, but
sometimes in a very elementary fashion, by pulling
down their hat or cap over the face and making two
holes through it for the eyes. Normally they ought
to search only for arms and to take only arms. But
everything degenerates, and the use of force often leads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
to the abuse of it. The Moonlighters not unfrequently
demand a supper, a sum of money, not to speak of
the company of some farm-wench to whom they may
take a fancy. This impartial offering of violence to
house and inmates might lead them far, were they
not certain of the discretion of the victims. But the
terror they inspire secures impunity to them.</p>

<p>Though everybody in a district knows perfectly well
who the intruders are, and though they have often
been recognized in spite of the mask, no one dares to
reveal their name. They are all too well aware that
in case of denunciation a nocturnal bullet will come
unerringly to the offender. Besides, a sort of poetical
halo and a political mantle of immunity surrounds
men who may sometimes, indeed, carry their zeal a
little too far, but are after all soldiers in the good
cause. The “legitimate” industry of the Moonlighters
allows their excesses to be forgotten. A sort
of general complicity covers and favours their expeditions.</p>

<p>That complicity goes sometimes to great lengths—for
instance the length of non-admitting the intervention
of the police in a house where the Moonlighters
are performing. The constables perambulating the
country hear screams, desperate appeals for help
in a farmhouse. They rush to it headlong and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
knock at the door. At once silence reigns. They
are asked from the inside of the house what they
want.</p>

<p>“We heard screams. Do you not want protection?”</p>

<p>“What business is that of yours?” is the answer.
“Go on your way, and do not come interfering and
preventing honest folks enjoying the possession of
their house undisturbed!...”</p>

<p>The unlucky constables can only beat a retreat and
go their round, often to meet shortly with the Moonlighters,
who will laugh at them, having comfortably
finished their business.</p>

<p>Before the judges the same thing occurs. Not a
witness will give evidence. And if by chance a witness
does speak, the jury take care to correct this
grave breach of etiquette in their verdict.</p>

<p>The witness, as well as the juryman, has often received
a warning. Working alone in the fields, or
following a lonely path, he has suddenly seen a little
puff of white smoke going up from the bushes some
feet in front of him, and he has heard a bullet
whizzing over his head. It was a Moonlighter telling
him:—</p>

<p>“Be silent, or thou art a dead man.”</p>

<p>Castleisland. A small town of little interest,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
after the pattern of most Irish boroughs. We stop
for lunch at a tavern of rather good appearance, and
clearly very popular with the natives. The innkeeper
smokes a cigar with us. Is he satisfied with the state
of affairs? Yes and no. Certainly he cannot complain—trade
in liquor is rather brisk. But there are
too many places where one can buy drink in the
town—no less than fifty-one.</p>

<p>“And do they all prosper?”</p>

<p>“Nearly all.”</p>

<p>“What may their average receipts be?”</p>

<p>“I should say about £400 a year.”</p>

<p>£400 multiplied by fifty-one gives £20,400, more
than 510,000 francs. And there is not in this place
any other industry than agriculture, while statistics
I have this moment in my pocket inform me that
the aggregate rental of Castleisland is not above
£14,000. It is then evident that, times good, times
bad, they drink every year here £6,000 worth more in
beer and spirits than they would pay in rent to the
landlords, if they chose to pay. This seems to be
conclusive, as far as Castleisland is concerned. But is
there really any reason why the tenants of this district
should turn total abstainers for the special purpose of
paying the claret and champagne bills of half-a-dozen
absentees? Here is the whole problem in a nutshell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>Tralee. The big town of the county, what we
should call in France the <i>chef-lieu</i>, the seat of the
assizes. They are opened precisely at this moment.
There are on the rolls three men charged with agrarian
murder. I proposed to go and be present at the
trials, when I heard that the three cases were to be
remanded to the next session, the representative of
the Crown having come to the conclusion that the
jury would systematically acquit the prisoners, as is
so often the case in Ireland.</p>

<p>The Chairman of the Assizes, Mr. Justice O’Brien,
seized this occasion to declare, that in the course of
an already long career he had never met with a jury
having so little regard for their duty. “It must be
known widely,” he added, “the law becomes powerless
when the course of justice is systematically impeded
by the very jurymen, as we see it in this country; in
which case there is no longer any security for persons
or property.”</p>

<p>To which the people in Kerry answer that they do
not care a bit for English law; what they want is
good Irish laws, made in Dublin by an Irish Parliament.</p>

<p>“It is quite true that we have no security here for
persons or property,” a doctor of the town said to me
in the evening. “The outrages were at first exclusively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
directed against the landlords, rightly or wrongly
accused of injustice and harshness in their dealings
with their tenants; but for the last two or three
years the field of nocturnal aggression has enlarged
greatly—a shot now serves to settle any personal
quarrel and even trade accounts. In the beginning
the jury at least made a distinction between the
different motives that actuated the accused. Now
they always acquit them, <i>because they no longer dare
to find them guilty</i>.... What will you have?...
Jurymen are but men. They prefer sending a ruffian
at large to paying with their life a too subtle distinction
between crimes of an agrarian character and
those of another sort. A lump of lead is the most
irresistible of arguments. One may assert that
presently law has lost all influence in Kerry. It
is rapine that reigns, hardly tempered by the decrees
of the National League, which of course means only
legitimate resistance to the landlords, and by the
fund of righteousness possessed at heart by the
nation. But let things go on thus only for two
years more, we shall have gone back to the savage
state.”</p>

<p>“Some people tell me, however, that raiding for
money is never seen in this part of Ireland.”</p>

<p>“Raiding for money never seen! I would rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
say it is the latest development of moonlighting.
Any one who covets a piece of his neighbour’s land,
who wishes to influence his vote for a board of
guardians, who is animated by any motive of vulgar
greed or spite, has only to set the Moonlighters in
motion. The machinery is at hand.”</p>

<p>“Could you really give me a few recent instances
of moonlighting for money?”</p>

<p>“Of course I could. There is one Daniel Moynihan,
at Freemount, near Rathmore: in October,
1886, a party of six men with blackened faces
entered his house at night, and breaking open a
box, carried away all his money. In January, 1887,
at Ballinillane, three men armed with guns entered
Daniel Lyne’s house and asked for money, threatening
to shoot him if he refused; they took away £6.
At Faha, in March, 1887, a party of six armed men
visited the house of Mr. E. Morrogh Bernard; they
demanded money, and got what was in the house.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>“You don’t say the League has anything to do
with such obvious cases of non-political moonlighting,
do you? It is a well-known fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
organization discountenances moonlighting as well as
all other violent practices.”</p>

<p>“It does in a manner, but at the same time, by
forming in each district a kind of police of the League,
an executive body ready for action, it singles out to
malignant persons men who may be ready for a
private job.”</p>

<p>There is obviously considerable exaggeration, or,
rather, distortion of facts, in the above statement, as
in everything relating to the League on one side or
the other. The truth is probably that ruffians, when
they want a job in the house-breaking line, ask for
nobody’s permission, but are only too glad to take
moonlighting as a pretence; and thus, common
breaches of the law which in ordinary times would go
by their proper name, are now ascribed to Moonlighters.
The bulk of the population, which is thoroughly
honest, has only words of contempt and hatred for
what, in justice, should rather be called a deviation
than a development of moonlighting.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Nine o’clock at night. In a hollow on the road to
Milltown, a man tries to hide himself behind some
shrubs; but perceiving that we do not belong to the
neighbourhood he shows himself. He is a constable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
clad in uniform, the black helmet on his head, a
loaded gun on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Why do you seek to avoid attention?”</p>

<p>“Because we are watching that farm-house there on
the height, my comrades and I; we have received information
to the effect that some men propose to
attack it one of these nights; now, we must try not to
be seen by the people on the farm, for they would
hasten to tell their assailants.”</p>

<p>“What! these people would denounce you to those
who come to rob them?”</p>

<p>“Just so. We have to protect them against their
will. Oh! it is indeed a nice trade to be a constable
in Ireland!” &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Then follow professional complaints that throw a
curious light on the relations between police and
population. The unhappy constables are <i>boycotted</i>
personally and as a body. Nobody speaks to them.
It is next to impossible for them to procure the first
necessaries of life. Government has to distribute
rations to them as to soldiers on a campaign. If they
want a conveyance, a cart to transport a detachment
of the public force where their presence is wanted,
nobody—even among the principal interested—will
give means of transport either for gold or silver. The
Government have had to give the constabulary special<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
traps that are constantly to be met on the roads, and
that one recognizes by their blood-red colour.</p>

<p>That police corps, <i>the Irish Constabulary Force</i>, is
very numerous, and entails great expense—more than
one million and a half sterling per year. The cost
would hardly be half a million if the Irish police were
on the same footing as the English force; that fact
alone can give an adequate idea of the real state of
things. Besides, numerous auxiliaries, called <i>Emergency
men</i>, are always ready to give their help to the
regular corps.</p>

<p>Be they soldiers or policemen, Great Britain keeps
nearly 50,000 armed men in Ireland. The male adult
and able population of the island being under
500,000 men, of whom 200,000 at least are opposed
to the agrarian and autonomist movement, one
can assume that there is on an average one
armed soldier or constable for every six unarmed
Irishmen.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On the dusty road before us are slowly walking
five cows in rather an emaciated condition. Those
beasts strike me by an odd appearance which I am
unable to make out at first. When I am close
to them I see what it is: <i>they have no tails</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
absence of that ornament gives the poor animals the
awkwardest and most absurd look.</p>

<p>I turn to my guide, who is laughing in his sleeve.</p>

<p>“Look at their master!” he whispers in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“The cows have no tails, and the man has no
ears....”</p>

<p>It is true. The unlucky wretch vainly endeavoured
to hide his head, as round as a cheese, under the brim
of his battered old hat; he did not succeed in
hiding his deformity.</p>

<p>“By Jove! who arranged you in this guise, you
and your cows?” I said to the poor devil, stopping
before him.</p>

<p>He made a few grimaces before explaining; but
the offer of a cigar, that rarely misses its effect, at
last unloosed his tongue. He then told me that the
Moonlighters had come with a razor to cut his ears, a
week after having cut the tails of his cows as a
warning.</p>

<p>“And what could have been the motive of such
cowardly, barbarous mutilation?”</p>

<p>He had accepted work on a <i>boycotted</i> farm, though
the League had expressly forbidden it; in other
words, he was what the Irish call a “land-grabber.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going with your cows?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>“To sell them at Listowel, if I may, which is not
certain.”</p>

<p>“Why is it not certain? Because they are unprovided
with a tail? At the worst that would only
prevent them being made into ox-tail soup,” I say,
trying to enliven the conversation by an appropriate
joke.</p>

<p>“That’s not it,” answers the man. “But the interdict
applies to the sale of the cows as well as to
having any intercourse with me. I am forbidden to
buy anything, and anyone speaking to me is fined
two shillings.”</p>

<p>He seemed to think this perfectly natural and even
just, like the Leper of the “Cité d’Aoste,” or like
common convicts when one talks to them of their
punishment.</p>

<p>“I gambled and I lost—so much the worse for
me!...” all his resigned attitude seemed to say.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they don’t know it yet in Listowel!” he
resumed with a sigh, and hopefully pushed on with
his cows.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Have there been many cases of such agrarian
mutilation in the country?” I ask MacMahon.</p>

<p>“No,” said my guide. “Perhaps half a dozen or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
so within the year.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> They used to be much more
numerous, but somehow they seem to go out of
fashion under the sway of the League. But there are
still other ways of annoying the enemy; fires are very
frequent, so are blows, personal injuries, and even
murder, threatening letters, and, above all, verbal
intimidation.”</p>

<p>Such proceedings, I understand, are altogether disowned
by the chiefs of the League, who only patronise
<i>boycotting</i>. Let a farmer, small or great, decline to
enter the organisation, or check it by paying his rent
to the landlord without the reduction agreed to by
the tenantry, or take the succession of an evicted
tenant on his holding, or commit any other serious
offence against the law of land war, he is at once
boycotted. That is to say, he will no longer be able
to sell his goods, to buy the necessaries of life, to
have his horses shod, his corn milled, or even to
exchange one word with a living soul, within a circuit
of fifteen to twenty miles round his house. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
servants are tampered with and induced to leave him,
his tradespeople are made to shut their door in his
face, his neighbours compelled to cut him. It is a
kind of excommunication, social, political and commercial;
an interdict sometimes aggravated with
direct vexations. People come and play football on
his oat fields, his potatoes are rooted out, his fish or
cattle poisoned, his game destroyed.</p>

<p>“But supposing that instead of bearing meekly
such indignities, he shows a bold front, shoulders his
gun and keeps watch?”</p>

<p>“Then his business is settled. Some day or other,
he will receive a bullet in his arm, if not in his head.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It will not perhaps be unnecessary to explain here
the origin of that word <i>boycott</i>, so frequently used
during the late few years. Everybody knows that on
the British side of the Channel, but the French reader
is not bound to remember it so exactly.</p>

<p>In September, 1881, at a mass meeting held in
Clare County, Mr. Parnell almost without being aware
of the importance of his words, advised his friends, to
exclude from the pale of social life whoever should
eject a tenant for reason of an unpaid rent, or take
the succession of the evicted farmer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>The first application of that new penalty fell upon
a certain Captain Boycott, a retired officer, who had
applied himself to agriculture. Having had occasion
to evict an obdurate defaulter, he saw himself within
a few days forsaken by his servants, tabooed by his
neighbours, reduced to dig out his own potatoes, and
generally to become his own valet.</p>

<p>The affair produced great sensation. The whole
press talked about it. Legions of reporters flocked
to the spot to follow the phases of the war waged
between Captain Boycott and his opponents. Upon
a memorable occasion a regular army of Orangemen,
7000 strong, they say, came over from Ulster to
give a lift to him and help him to get in the harvest
which threatened to rot standing. But the place became
too hot for Captain Boycott. He was obliged to
give way at last and leave his place in Connaught.
(By the way, he ultimately returned there, and is now
quite popular.)</p>

<p>In the meanwhile his name, used as a proverb, or
rather as a <i>verb</i>, has come to describe a way of intimidation,
which at the hands of the League is a
redoubtable weapon, more powerful than a hundred
batteries of 100-ton guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Could you show me anybody who is actually
under boycott?”</p>

<p>“Could I? That will not be difficult. There!
Mr. Kennedy, beyond that clump of trees. He has
been boycotted eighteen months.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I might call on him?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. But I shall ask leave to wait for
you outside the gate, sir, on account of the League of
course.——You may laugh at its verdict, not I.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, I was at Mr. Kennedy’s gate.
A little country house rather decayed, in the
middle of grounds which no gardener has seen for at
least two years. Nobody in sight. I try the bell-rope.
It remains in my hand. I am then reduced
to an energetic tattoo on the plate which shuts the
lower part of the gate.</p>

<p>Attracted by the unusual noise, a tall white-haired
man makes his appearance at an upper window.
Surprised at first, and even somewhat alarmed, he
listens to my request, is reassured, and even comes to
unbar the door. As I had hoped, he is not sorry to
unloose his tongue a little, and with the best grace
possible tells me the whole affair.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am boycotted for having, single among all
his tenants, paid to my landlord the entire rent of
those meadows you see yonder. How do I take my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
situation? Well, as a philosopher. At the beginning,
I thought it inconvenient to be deprived of new
bread, to do without meat, and worse still, to be left
without servants. But I have learnt by degrees to
accommodate myself to my new condition. I have
made provisions for a siege. I have found a few
servants, strangers to the district, and made my
arrangements to send my butter to Cork by rail. On
the whole, there is not much to complain of. I
should, of course, prefer things to follow their usual
course. It is tedious at times to find oneself out of
the pale of humanity. But you end by discovering
that solitude has its advantages. You develop
accomplishments up to that time latent in you. For
instance, I shoe my horses myself; I have learnt
to set a window pane, to sweep a chimney. My
daughters have improved in cooking. We eat a great
many chickens; now and then we kill a sheep; when
we want butcher-meat, we must send rather far for
it. The same for beer, wine, and many other commodities.
It <i>is</i> inconvenient—no more.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At Listowel; a market day. Great animation on
the market-place; tongues are busy; whisky seems
to be flowing freely at every tap-room and tavern.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
But not much business is done, as far as I can judge.
My guide calls my attention to two interesting
phenomena that I should not, perhaps, have noticed
otherwise.</p>

<p>The first is a man in breeches, with bare calves, a
<i>shillelagh</i> under his arm, who seems to be a farmer in
a small way. He approaches a wheel-barrow filled
with big hob-nailed shoes, which a woman is dragging,
and falls to examining them, evidently intent on
buying a pair. Almost at the same moment, a boy
of fifteen or sixteen comes to the other side of the
woman and whispers something in her ear. She
nods. At once the customer, turning very red in
the face, lets go the pair of shoes and turns away.
MacMahon says the man is a newly boycotted man
and the boy an agent of the League, whose function
consists in reporting the interdict to those who have
not heard of it as yet.</p>

<p>The other phenomenon is more remarkable. It is
a stout gentleman in a shooting-jacket, carrying
a double-barrelled gun of the latest model, and
followed by a constable who also carries his regulation
gun. The stout gentleman stops before a door
where a smart <i>outside car</i> with a servant in livery
is waiting for him. He takes his seat; the constable
jumps on after him. Is the stout gentleman under a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, I wonder, and is he going to be
taken into the county jail? Not a bit of it. He is
simply a landowner under threat of death, who has
thought fit to indulge in a body-guard. He and the
constable are henceforth inseparable.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A large tract of uncultivated land. It was farmed
at £60 a year. The farmer was a sporting man, fond
of races and the like. To simplify his work he had
the whole property converted into pasture. But his
expensive mode of living obliged him now and then
to sell a few head of cattle. The hour came when
he had not one calf left, and he found himself utterly
incapable of paying his rent. He was evicted.
Sure not to find another tenant, on account of the
law laid down by the League that every evicted farm
should be left unoccupied, the landlord had recourse
to the only sort of <i>métayage</i> known in Ireland.
(<i>Métayage</i>, it should be explained, is the kind of
farming used in most French provinces, where the
owner of the land enters into yearly partnership with
his tenant, and advances the necessary capital in
the shape of manure, seed, beasts of burden, and
machinery, on the understanding that the crops be
shared equally between himself and the tenant.)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
To return to my Kerry landlord: he set up on his
meadows a caretaker, with a salary of twenty-five
shillings a week and forty cows to keep. At the end of
the first month the tails of ten cows had been chopped
off, while two of them had died from suspicious inflammation
of the bowels. It became necessary to put
the cows, and the caretaker as well, under the protection
of a detachment of police. Cost: two pounds a
week for each constable. Nett loss at the end of the
half-year: £60. The landlord wisely judged that it
would be much better to send his cows to the
slaughter-house, to pay off caretaker and police, and
to forget that he ever was a landowner.</p>

<p>In the same district, another farm gone waste.
The tenant did not pay. He was evicted, but had
another holding close by, where he encamped, and
from that vantage-ground sent the following ultimatum
to his <i>ci-devant</i> landlord:—“The hay I have
left on my late farm is worth £30. I demand fifteen
for allowing you to mow and sell it; you shall
not see a shilling of it on any other terms.” Fury
of the landlord. Then he cools down, thinks
better of it, offers ten pounds. The evicted tenant
declines the offer; a whole army would not
have brought him round. Meanwhile, the hay got
rotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>By the road-side near Castlemaine, is a row of
barracks, where men, women, and children are
huddled together. Those are <i>League-huts</i>, that is to
say, a temporary shelter which the League offers to
ejected tenants, for having, upon its command, declined
to pay their rent. The cabins from which the poor
wretches have been turned out, although they had,
as a rule, built them themselves, are within shooting
distance, on the right hand. They bear evident traces
of having been fired by the sheriff’s officers in order to
make them uninhabitable, and they present the desolate
aspect of homesteads adjoining a field of battle. Walls
broken by the crowbar, doors ajar, rubbish and ruins
everywhere. Is it politic on the part of the landlords
to add the horrors of fire to those of eviction?
Hardly so, the outsider will think. It adds nothing
to the majesty of the law to wage war with inanimate
things. The exercise of a right ought never to
assume the appearance of an act of revenge.
Wrongly or rightly, eviction by itself always bears an
odious character; but to see the house you have built
with your own hands burnt to the ground will ever
seem to cry for vengeance to Heaven. And, after all,
who is the gainer by such violence? The League.
It takes care to retain the victims of eviction within
sight of the scene of their woes, feeds them, harbours<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
them, exhibits them as in an open museum, by the
side of their destroyed homes. And it is a permanent,
practical lesson for the passer-by, a realistic drama
where the landlord appears torch in hand, while the
League dries the tears of the afflicted and allows
them £2 a week. That is the usual pay for one
family.</p>

<span class="smaller">A KERRY FARMER’S BUDGET.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“I wonder how landlords can manage to live, under
such conditions,” I said to my guide. “Are there any
tenants left paying their rent?”</p>

<p>“There are many. First, those who have been able
to come to an agreement with their landlord about
the reduction of 20, 25, 30 per cent. that they claimed;
in such cases the landlord’s income is reduced, but at
least he still retains a part of it. Then, there is
the tenant’s live stock; he cannot prevent its being
seized for rent, in case of execution, and consequently
chooses to pay, if possible, or he would have to sell
his cattle to avoid distress, which means ruin to the
family. Lastly, there are the tenants who pay
secretly, although pretending to adhere to the rules of
the League—<i>backsliders</i> they are called—a class more
numerous than could be supposed at first sight.”</p>

<p>Here MacMahon laughed. He went on:</p>

<p>“I will tell you, Sir, a story I have heard lately, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
a man in county Cork, who wanted to pay his landlord
but dared not, on account of the other tenants
on the estate. Coming across the landlord on a lone
road (not improbably after many an unfruitful attempt
for such a propitious opportunity) he stood before
him in a threatening attitude. ‘Put your hand in my
coat’s inside pocket!’ he said gruffly. The landlord
did not understand at first what the man meant, and
considering his look and address, was far from feeling
reassured. ‘What do you mean?’ he asked uneasily.
‘I tell you, sir, put your hand in my coat’s inside
pocket, and feel for what you find in it.’ At last the
landlord did as he was bidden. He put his hand in
the man’s pocket, and extracted from it a bundle of
papers, carefully tied up, that looked like banknotes.
At once the tenant took to his heels. ‘The devil a
penny of rent you can ever say I paid you,’ said he, in
the same strange threatening tone of voice, as he ran
away. Still, the banknotes in the landlord’s hand
were exactly to the amount of the rent due. As a
rule, when the tenant is really able to pay his rent, he
pays it.”</p>

<p>Such has not been the general case, it seems, for
the last three years. <i>In produce</i>, perhaps the Irish
farmer might have paid his rent, as the crops have
been, on the whole, fairly up to the average. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
<i>money</i>, he cannot, because the fall of prices on hay,
potatoes, beef, mutton, pork, and butter alike, in 1885,
1886, 1887, has been at least 20 per cent. on the
former and average prices, which not only means no
margin whatever of profit to the farmer, besides his
necessary expenses, but in most cases the sheer impossibility
of providing for the forthcoming outlay in
seeds, manure, and labour.</p>

<p>This may not be self-evident. Many a reader probably
fails to see why a fall of 20 per cent. on the
prices of agricultural produce must necessarily entail
a total disability to pay the rent. “I can well understand
the demand of a proportional reduction of rent
in such cases,” he will say, “but not absolute non-payment.”
To fully realise the situation, one must
go into the details of a farmer’s life.</p>

<p>Let us take the case of Denis O’Leary, a Kerry
man, with fourteen acres of good land. He seems to
be in easy circumstances; his house is clean and
pretty; he owns three cows, two sows, ten sheep,
and about a score hens. Denis O’Leary is a good
man, industrious and thrifty, who does all the work on
his farm, with the help of wife and three children.
He likes his pipe of tobacco, and on Sundays, a glass
of beer over the counter with a friend or two,
but otherwise indulges in no expensive habits. On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
the whole he can be considered a pattern tenant, as well
as one of the most fortunate of his class. His rent,
which had been gradually raised by his landlord up to
the sum of £11 6<i>s.</i>, was in 1883 put down at £8 7<i>s.</i>
by the Land Commissioners.</p>

<p>Such being the case, when we are told that the same
Denis O’Leary, who was for five years able to pay the
larger rent, is now unable to pay the smaller one, this
may look absurd. Still, it is the simple truth. To
ascertain the fact, it is only necessary to make the
budget of the O’Leary family.</p>

<p>The yearly expenditure, unavoidable and irreducible,
is as follows:—</p>

<p>Most assuredly there is nothing excessive in such
a budget of expenditure for a family of four. If even
it is possible for Denis O’Leary not to go beyond its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
narrow limits, it is because he consumes in kind a large
proportion of the produce of his fourteen acres, namely,
some hundred stones of potatoes, with a good deal of
milk, eggs, and butter. This alimentary deduction
duly made, he has still a certain quantity of agricultural
produce (which shall be supposed here a constant
quantity) to sell, as follows:—</p>

<p>The above commodities have not, unfortunately, a
constant value. They sell more or less, according to
the fluctuations of prices on the market. In 1882,
1883, 1884, prices were high. Denis O’Leary’s revenue
was consequently as under:—</p>

<p>When Denis O’Leary had deducted from his revenue
of £43 11<i>s.</i> the yearly expenditure of £31 10<i>s.</i>, he
had still £12 1<i>s.</i> left. He was able, accordingly, to
pay £8 <i>7s.</i> rent (or even £11 6<i>s.</i> before the judicial
reduction), and the rent duly paid, he was still the
proud nett gainer of four shillings under the old
<i>régime</i>, of £3 14<i>s.</i> under the new.</p>

<p>Unhappily, prices fell down in 1885, 1886, and 1887,
to the tune of 25 or 30 per cent. on nearly all agricultural
produce, with the exception perhaps of oats
and eggs, so that the revenue of the O’Leary family

<p>Thus, the revenue and expenditure are nearly equal,
with a slight balance of nineteen shillings, that could
hardly be proffered for rent. Local usurers are not
wanting, of course, who will advance to Denis O’Leary
the necessary funds, at 10 or 15 per cent., if he wants
to pay the landlord, all the same. But then his
budget is no more in a state of equilibrium: deficit
enters it, to widen every year up to the final catastrophe.
In other words, Denis O’Leary cannot pay
the rent, unless he draws on his capital. One may
well understand that he should not relish the idea,
considering especially that the landlord’s rack-rent
has been reduced three years ago in the Land Court,
and that the same landlord demurs to a fresh reduction,
so obviously just and necessary that all landlords
in England have granted it of their own free will
these last three years.</p>

<p>And Denis O’Leary is a wonder in his class: he is
an industrious, hard-working, wise man, without a
penny of previous debt. He has precisely the area of
land adequate to his means, and the live-stock indispensable
to manure the soil. He does not drink, he
does not gamble, he is never ill, he has no old people
to support, he has not experienced failures or mishaps
of any kind, and his crops are fairly up to the
average.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>Let us come back, however, to the world as it is,
and see Man with his foibles, his usual neglects, errors,
and mishaps. Let us suppose that he has more land
on his hands than he can well manage to till, or that
his holding, on the contrary, is too small for his wants.
Let us suppose that instead of selling three pigs and
two calves, he was not able to rear them, or lost them
from disease; that instead of bringing to market
1,800 lbs. of potatoes he had to buy some hundred-weight
of the same for domestic consumption—the man
is lost, irretrievably lost. Not only will he never be
able to pay the landlord one farthing, but it will be
enough that the crops should be slightly under the
average to make a hopeless beggar of him—a case of
outdoor or indoor relief for the parish.</p>

<p>Now, these are the circumstances of six or seven
tenants out of ten in the lowlands of Kerry, where
they seem to be comparatively well off. If we leave
the plains for the higher districts bordering on the
sea, the question is simpler still. There is no need of
long accounts here. The hour of irretrievable misery
has struck long ago, and habitual hunger stares us in
the face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Up in the Mountains.</span></p>

<p>The mountains of Kerry are the finest in the island.
They form its south-western angle, throwing out on
the Atlantic the peninsula of Dingle, between the bay
of the same name and the Kenmare River. As you
leave the plain following the Cahirciveen road
towards the coast, you see them develop their
parallel ranges, which are divided by deep valleys.
Some of these valleys are fertile, being watered by
impetuous streams from the mountain side. But the
general impression one receives is that of agricultural
poverty, as is the case in nearly all mountainous countries
in the world. Pastures are thinner, cattle less
numerous, homesteads fewer and more miserable than
in the plain. Human creatures themselves partake
of the general look of wretchedness that prevails.
They live on potatoes, milk, and porridge; seldom eat
bread, meat never; wine, beer, tea, coffee are to them
unknown luxuries. Their ill-shaped cottages are
made of soft stone, with a thatched roof maintained
by ropes made of straw. There they all sleep on a bed
of rushes, which they share with the pig, when there
is such a thing, for even the traditional pig has become
now a symptom of wealth in a manner. On the
beams of the roof roost perhaps half-a-dozen hens
and chickens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>Sloth and dirt hold here an undivided sway. Not
a woman—and some are pretty—seems to mind the
spots and holes in her garments; not one knows the
use of soap or needle. They appear to have a rooted
dislike for the comb; their hair falls on their back as
is the fashion among the Australian aborigines, in
nature’s simple disorder.</p>

<p>Men look heavy and apathetic. They work as
little as they can manage—one or two days out of
seven, perhaps—and do not even think of seeking their
sustenance from the sea, which is so close to them. The
most they can do is to draw from it now and then a
cart-load of seaweed to manure their miserable plot
of ground. Their existence rolls on dull, idle, devoid
of interest. It is the brute life in its most wretched
and hideous state. Here is old Ireland as Gustave de
Beaumont’s admirable book showed it to us fifty years
ago. Hardly do those wretched products of Anglo-Saxon
civilization receive a faint echo of the outer
world when the electoral time comes.</p>

<p>The consequence is that the agrarian crisis is reduced
here to its simplest expression, <i>i.e.</i>, sheer impossibility
to pay the rent because of total absence
of the £ <i>s.</i> <i>d.</i> wherewith. Elsewhere that impossibility
may be half assumed; it is certainly mixed in the
plain with bad will, goaded in the peasant’s heart by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
that dogged desire to possess the land which is so
natural in him. In the mountain it is not a political
fiction that holds the sway: famine is the king; and
it is the spontaneous product of the very nature of
things.</p>

<p>For the naturally infertile soil has reached here to
such a degree of subdivision that it is no longer sufficient
even to feed those it bears. The greater part of
those wretched holdings of five or six acres are let at
the nominal price of about £4, to which must be added
the taxes, poor-rates, and county-cess, increasing it by
a quarter or a third. Four, five, six, sometimes ten or
twelve beings with human faces squat on that bit of
worthless ground and till it in the most primitive
manner. Money, tools, intelligence, pluck, all are wanting
there. Viewing things in the most optimist light,
supposing the year to have been an exceptionally
good one, the potato crop to have been plentiful, the
cow to have hunted out on the hill-side the necessary
grass for the making of a little butter, all that will be
sufficient perhaps to prevent starvation. But where
will the money be found to pay Queen and landlord?</p>

<p>Let a child or an old person eat ever so little in
the year, his food cannot but represent a value. Let
that value be £4. Can six acres of mountain ground<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
managed without skill or manure, render five, six, ten
times £4 a year, and a rent in addition of five to six
pounds? It is sheer impossibility.</p>

<p>A few examples.</p>

<p>James Garey, fifty years old, married, four children.
Nominal rent £5 14<i>s.</i> Two cows, one pig, eight
chickens. About six acres of land. Cultivates only
part of it, about three acres, where he grows potatoes;
the remainder is pasture. Sold this year thirty
shillings’ worth of butter; ate his potatoes from first
to last; has not paid a farthing to his landlord for
the last four years. Owes £6 to the draper-grocer;
would never be able to pay his taxes if two of his
children, who are out in domestic situations, did not
send him the necessary amount to prevent execution.</p>

<p>Widow Bridget Molony, sixty years old; five
children; seven acres of land. Nominal rent £6 12<i>s.</i>
Four cows, an eighteen-month-old calf, two pigs,
twenty chickens. Sold £3 10<i>s.</i> of butter this year,
£2 oats, 15 shillings potatoes, and a pig for £3;
just sent a calf to market, offering it for £1 15<i>s.</i>; did
not find purchaser. Thinks herself relatively lucky,
as she is owing only two years’ rent to her landlord.
Two of her children have situations at Liverpool, and
help her to pay the taxes.</p>

<p>Thomas Halloran, forty years. Three children,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
eight acres of land; rent £6 15<i>s.</i> Two cows, fifteen
sheep, a pig, an ass, twelve chickens. Sold during the
year ten shillingsworth of butter and ten sheep at
twelve shillings a head. Has paid nothing to landlord
since November, 1884.</p>

<p>Michael Tuohy, seventy years old, three children,
four grandchildren. Nine acres of land, £7 rent. A
cow and five hens. Can no longer afford a pig. Sold
only fifteen shillingsworth of butter this year, and had
to get rid of two cows out of three to pay the ten per
cent interest of a debt he has contracted with the
National Bank. Owes four years’ rent to his landlord;
hopes that his son, who has emigrated to the
United States, will send him the money for the
taxes; if the son doesn’t, he cannot see any way to
save the last cow.</p>

<p>Examples of that description could be multiplied
<i>ad infinitum</i>; they are, so to say, the rule in the
mountainous districts, where the holdings are for
the most part beneath £10 rent, and totally unequal
even to sustain the farmer.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Glenbeigh, between Kilarglin and Cahirciveen.
This place was the theatre of several deplorable
scenes in January last, on Mr. R. Winn’s property.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
That property, very extensive, but consisting of poor,
not to say totally barren land, was put down at
£2000 on the valuation roll. The aforesaid rent not
having been paid during four or five years, the owner
was of course in very strait circumstances; he had
to go to some Jews, who substituted themselves in his
place, and undertook to enforce payment. But the
extreme poverty of the tenants proved even stronger
than the energetic tribe. In consequence of the
gradual subdivision of the land, they had come to
hold diminutive scraps of it such as could not even
grow the potatoes sufficient for their sustenance.
After various judicial skirmishes, the plain result
of which was to establish the utter incapacity of the
peasants to give a penny, the council of creditors
resolved in the depth of winter to undertake a wholesale
campaign of evictions. Seventy-nine writs of
ejectment were issued, and soon after the under-sheriff,
backed by a strong detachment of mounted
constables, arrived to evict the wretched families.</p>

<p>The operations began at a certain Patrick Reardon’s,
on a literally barren land, for which he was expected
to pay £4 10<i>s.</i> a year. He was the father of eight
children, but did not even possess a pig, not a pair of
chickens. The furniture consisted of a bed, a rickety
table and a kettle. Squatting on the ground with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
whole family, according to the time-honoured custom,
he waited for the executors of the law. Requested
to pay, he answered that he possessed not one
farthing; he was then informed that they were going
to set fire to his cabin, in order to oblige him to
evacuate the premises. The act soon followed the
threat. A lighted match applied to the thatched roof,
and in a few minutes the whole was in conflagration.
All the neighbouring populations, who had run on to
the scene of the tragedy, saluted the dreadful deed
with hooting and execration.</p>

<p>The myrmidons of the law pursued nevertheless
the execution of their mandate. They went next to
the dwelling of another tenant, Thomas Burke,
inscribed on the list of debtors for a sum of £20. He
had five children, and, like the above-mentioned, not
one farthing to offer to the creditors. Order was
given to set fire to his roof, but it was found to be so
damp that fire would not take; so they had to attack
the walls with the crowbar and pick-axe. The
miserable inmates appeared then to the eyes of the
indignant crowd, half naked, wan, emaciated, and
starved; and so heartrending was the scene that with
difficulty the representative of the League (who had
come there for that very purpose) prevented the mob
from stoning the bailiffs to death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>Then came the turn of the third cottage. Two old
men lived in it, Patrick and Thomas Diggin. The
family of the former included ten persons; that of
the latter, six. They owed a rent of £8, and had not
a shilling between them all. Patrick’s wife, however,
came forward, and declared she had just received £2
from her daughter, who was a servant in Belfast.
Would they accept that, and stop the execution?
The under-sheriff, whom the duties of his office oblige
to back the bailiffs, urged them to accept the touching
offer. They refused, and set fire to the roof. Then
Patrick Diggin, an eighty-year-old man, was seen
coming out of his home sobbing; he was followed by
all his children and grandchildren. By an irresistible
impulse of sympathy all crowd round him, offering
what little they possess to the relief of that misery.
The constables themselves, moved almost to tears,
contribute their silver coin to the subscription which
has been spontaneously organized. To carry the
barbarous work further becomes an impossibility. The
sheriff’s substitute gives the signal for departure, and
the cavalcade follows amidst the derisive cries of the
multitude.</p>

<p>All those poor people, except one family, have since
been re-installed on their holdings, and are now at
work on their farms—a strange evidence of the uselessness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
and cruelty of eviction, to make tenants pay
who cannot.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Valentia Island.</span></p>

<p>At Cahirciveen, I crossed the strait which divides
the main land from the island of Valentia. This is
the extreme point of the old continent, where the
Transatlantic cables are placed. Good, honest, plucky
fellows! what repose after the misery of Kerry! I
am speaking of the fishermen of the island, a peculiar
race who never ploughed any fields but those of the
ocean. Every night they risk their lives on the giant
billows, and earn their bread valiantly. They know
nothing of sheep rot, potato disease, or landlordism;
all they know is the management of their
boats, the making and mending of their nets, and the
art of making the deep yield food for their young.
Strangers to the neighbouring world, they ignore even
its language, and only talk the rude idiom of their
ancestors, the Irish of the time of the O’Donoghue.</p>

<p>Noble fellows! I shall not soon forget the night I
spent there watching them as they were fishing
between the Skellings, two enormous rocks that rise
like Gothic cathedrals, about twelve miles from Bray
Head, and on which the waves are eternally breaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
with a thundering noise. My guide had warned me
against offering them money; it would offend them,
he said, so I did not do it. I simply drank with
them a glass of whisky when they prepared to go
home towards daybreak, the stars still shining.
And, comparing their happy courage with the distress
of Kerry, I wished them from the bottom of my
heart never to become acquainted with agriculture on
small holdings, under an English landlord.</p>

<span class="smaller">RURAL PHYSIOLOGY.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>We have glanced at a few facts presenting symptoms
of the Irish disease, which were taken as chance
guided us, in a ride through a south-western county.
Similar symptoms are everywhere to be found through
the island. To appreciate them at their right value,
as even to comprehend them, it is essentially requisite
to know, at least in its broader outlines, the physiology
of landed property in this entirely agricultural
country.</p>

<p>Vast landed property and parcelled-out culture. This
is the epitome of such a physiology. At the base of the
social edifice we find the tenant, generally a Catholic
and of indigenous race, occupying and cultivating after
his own fashion the thousandth or ten thousandth
part of a property ranging over an area of some
hundred thousand acres. At the summit we find
the landlord, almost invariably of English and Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
race, ruling by right of primogeniture over this
immense space.</p>

<p>Does this right rest at its origin on confiscation and
spoliation, as is averred by the Irish? That is of
little importance from a legal point of view, for prescription
has covered the spoliation by an occupation
of two to eight centuries. It is of far greater importance
from a moral point of view, because that
grievance, ill or well founded, serves as a handle for all
agrarian recriminations.</p>

<p>In three out of five cases (so it has been shown by
recent statistics) the landlord is an <i>absentee</i>, that is to
say, he does not reside on his property, nor even in
the kingdom, and spends abroad the money he
raises on his lands. His income, from that source
alone, is sometimes enormous—£10,000 a year—(Lord
Greville, Westmeath; Lord Carisford,
Wicklow; Mr. Wandesford, Kilkenny; Mr. King,
Longford; Lord Inchiquin, Clare); £16,000 a year—(Lord
Claremont, Louth; Mr. Naper, Meath; Lord
Leconfield, Clare; Lord Ventry, Kerry); £26,000
and £32,000 a year—(Duke of Abercorn, Tyrone;
Marquis of Clanricarde, Galway; Lord Kenmare,
Kerry); £40,000, £80,000, and even £120,000 a year—(Mr.
MacDonnell, Kildare; Marquis of Coningham,
Cavan, Clare, and Donegal; Marquis of Londonderry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
Down; Marquis of Downshire, &amp;c.). Rent
rolls of £4,000, £3,000, and £2,000 a year too
plentiful to be mentioned.</p>

<p>Three-fifths at least of those sums are lost every
year for Ireland, and they go out of the island
without having in any way helped to increase her
capital in agricultural machinery, live stock, and
general improvements of the land. As a natural
consequence, the soil is ill-cultivated, ill-manured,
insufficiently covered with cattle. For centuries its
energies have suffered a constant draining, and
nothing has been done to repair its losses.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That soil has a tendency to subdivision in the
hands of the tenants, who cultivate it by truly
pre-historic methods. The figures are given in round
numbers as follows:—</p>

<p>Against 24,000 holdings of a value of above £500
a year there are in Ireland 85,000 holdings producing
from £25 to £500 a year; 49,000 from £12 to £29
a year; 77,000 from £8 to £12 a year; 196,000 from
£4 to £8 a year; lastly, 218,000 holdings of a
revenue of <i>under £4 a year</i>.</p>

<p>That is to say, out of six or seven hundred thousand
families, living exclusively upon the product of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
soil, more than two-thirds must get their sustenance
from a wretched bit of ground, estimated by the
owner himself at a value of £4 to £8 a year!</p>

<p>To state such an economical paradox is to
denounce it. Where there is nothing, the landlord,
like the king, loses his rights. The situation, then,
would already be strangely anomalous, even if the
respective titles of landlord and tenant were of the
clearest and most transparent kind. But it is complicated
in Ireland by the most curious conceptions and
customs in matters of landed property.</p>

<p>To understand those conceptions and customs, a
Frenchman must begin by putting aside all his
Latin ideas. With us, since the Convention, one can
always know by the Survey-Rolls to whom belongs
absolutely such or such a piece of land. He who
owns it is free to sell it, to give it, to let it as he
pleases. His right is absolute; it is the right of
“use and abuse,” according to the forcible expression
of the Roman code. It passes with this absolute
character to sons, grandsons, or legatees.</p>

<p>In Ireland it is feudal law that obtains still;
an estate is not a property, it is a fief. The lord of
that estate is not the proprietor of it, he is an
usufructuary, as it were, a life-tenant on it. He has
only a limited right to his own land. He cannot sell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
it without the written consent of his substitute in the
entail, and the authorization of the persons, often
countless in numbers, that have some hereditary right
on his property at the same time with him; most of
the estates are encumbered with perpetual rents,
served out either to the younger branches of the
family, to old servants, or to creditors. All the titulary
is free to alienate is his life interest, through some
insurance combination with transfer of income.</p>

<p>If we add that the said titulary is generally absent
from his property, that he does not manage it personally,
and that in many cases he does not even
exactly know where it is to be found, we must own
that it is no wonder he is considered as a stranger.</p>

<p>A stranger he is besides, in race, by habits,
by religion, by language. And yet this stranger,—precisely
because his fief, practically inalienable, as it
is immovable in its limits, has always been transmitted
from father to eldest son in the family,—this
stranger, of whom often nothing is known beyond his
name, has a story, true or legendary, attached to him
and to his title. It matters little that the revenue of
the estate was scattered over five hundred heads, in
the course of ten generations; the estate remains,
and weighs on him with all its weight. We do not
speak here of a mere geographical expression, of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
area a hundred times parcelled out, altered, disfigured,
in less than a century, but of land that for a
thousand years, maybe, has changed neither form nor
aspect.</p>

<p>At night, by the fireside, old people will recall how
in former days this land was the collective property
of the clan; how they were defrauded by a political
chief that treacherously gave it up to the English, in
order to receive investiture from their hands; how,
following the fortunes of twenty successive rebellions
and repressions, it was confiscated, sequestered, given
anew, till it came to the actual landlords. A special
literature, ballads, popular imagery, little books, and
penny papers constantly harp on that ancient spoliation.
It is the only history studied under thatched
roofs. The peasant breathes it in the atmosphere,
imbibes it by all his pores.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Convinced that he has a hereditary right to the
domain in general, the Irish peasant besides attributes
to himself a special and prescriptive right to the plot of
ground that he, like the landlord, occupies from father
to son, though on a precarious tenure. This right is
not purely imaginary; it was consecrated in the
year 1860 by a special Act of Parliament, due to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
initiative of Mr. Gladstone. Recognised from immemorial
times in Ulster, it has always been claimed in
all the other parts of Ireland; it is the <i>tenant right</i>,
what in our own Picardy is called the <i>droit de
marché</i>.</p>

<p>It is well known in what consist this ancient prerogative
of the Picardy farmer (Troplong in the Preface
to his <i>Traité du Louage</i>, and Lefort in his <i>Histoire des
contrats de location perpétuelle</i>, have treated it exhaustively):
it is simply the privilege of preserving in
perpetuity for him and for his heirs, the use of the
ground for which he pays rent regularly.</p>

<p>Not only is this privilege not denied to him, but he
can transfer it to a third person, for a premium that
goes by the name of <i>intrade</i>. The amount of that
premium is often a third or even a half of the intrinsic
value of the soil. Formerly this “<i>droit de marché</i>”
applied to everything that can be let or hired; the
labourers, the threshers, the shepherds of a domain,
each claimed it in his own province as a hereditary
monopoly. In modern days it is strictly limited to
the hiring of servants, in the few districts where it
survived the French revolution (in Péronne for
instance).</p>

<p>The thing that is only a curious exception in
France has remained the rule in Ireland, where <i>tenant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
right</i> has been in force for the last twenty-seven
years. And what, after all, can be better founded
than such a right? Has not the tenant, in the
majority of cases, made his plot of ground what it is?
Has he not tilled it, improved it, manured it, drained
it according to his better knowledge; in a word, has
he not <i>created</i> it in its actual form?</p>

<p>“Let us,” says the peasant, “admit the rights of the
landlord. How could he deny me mine? Are they
not legibly written in the furrow I have traced upon
this earth, in the fruits I have made her bear?...
The land is not a simple material, unreducible like a
piece of gold. It is a chemical product, a conglomerate
that is valuable especially by reason of all the
substances I have mixed up with it during an occupation
of ten, twenty, thirty years, or even more....
Who shall dare to deny the share I have brought into
this company of which I am the acting manager, and
deny that this share belongs to me?”</p>

<p>Such a theory would doubtless appear sheer lunacy
to the French proprietor who has paid for his land £400
per hectare, and who has let it for a fixed period at a
fixed price, with the understanding that at the end of
the contract he shall find it in good condition and shall
then do what he pleases with it. That theory, however,
is so well suited to Ireland, where custom has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
the force of law, that the landlord does not even think,
practically, of disputing the <i>tenant’s right</i>.</p>

<p>As a rule he is only too glad to let his land to the
farmers who have traditionally occupied it, on condition
that they pay the usual rent.</p>

<p>But in practice, the Land Act of 1860, apparently
so much in favour of the tenant, has produced
disastrous effects. In the first place, by consecrating
the right of the tenant only on improvements and enlargements
made <i>with the landlord’s consent</i>. Thence
the consequence that not only is the landlord never
willing to spend a farthing on the improvements of
the land, but also that he systematically opposes
them, for fear he should have to pay for them in the
end. Besides many landlords have signed their new
leases only after the farmer has given them a formal
renunciation to the tenant right; or else they have
taken advantage of the pretext that offered itself, and
raised the rent by way of compensation against all
risks. Lastly, in many a place where this right has
become positive, the rural usurers alone have profited
by it by discounting it to the peasantry.</p>

<p>The consequence is that the tenant right is often reduced
practically to the implicit acknowledgment of the
right of the farmer to occupy the land, so long as he
pays his rent. It even happens not unfrequently that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
there is no lease and the occupancy goes on indefinitely
without title. Doubtless this gives it only
more value in the eyes of the peasant, naturally inclined
to associate this absence of scrivening with the
acknowledgment of his traditional rights.</p>

<p>Having been able in certain cases to sell or hire his
“interest,” he feels the more inclined to think himself
entitled to divide it between his children. That
division has become the rule, and what was once a
farm of thirty to fifty acres turns out, at the third
generation, parcelled in ten or twelve scraps of three
to five acres. The landlord might have interfered
in the beginning; he might have prevented such a
division; he did not do it. Beside, that division of
the land is recorded nowhere, has been the occasion
of no formal deed; one member of the family
answers for all the others, if necessary. How is one
to unravel those private arrangements? And, after
all, what does it matter, so long as the rents come
in?</p>

<p>They come in during ten, during twenty years.
Then the harvest is bad, or the sub-dividing of the
soil has arrived at the last limit compatible with the
needs of those that cultivate it. The rent is no
longer paid, and then the difficulties begin. How is
one to appraise the improvements introduced in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
land by the actual possessor, or by his forefathers?
How can one find out what is due to him, even with
the best intentions? Is the landlord to give him an
indemnity before he evicts him? But then it means
ruin to the landlord, who will have to pay precisely
because he has not been paid himself. It is the
squaring of the circle. When only very small
holdings are in question, the difficulty is generally
met by remaining in <i>statu quo</i>. But supposing the
debt to be more important, or to have been transferred
to a third person, which is often the case, the
question becomes insoluble.</p>

<p>Let us repeat that we must not consider these
things from a French point of view. With us the idea
of individual property is always of the clearest and
simplest. The frequent sales and buying of land
contribute still to make this idea of more actual and
definite meaning to us. An hectare of grass or vine
is, like any other goods, a merchandise that passes
from hand to hand, and remains with the highest
bidder. In Ireland the sales are rare, and in no case
is it a question of absolute ownership; it is only
a question about the respective and contradictory
rights, some for life, some perpetual, some positive,
others customary, of several persons over the same
space of land, a space not to be transferred, not to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
seized, and not to be fractionised. Is it any wonder
that such contradictory pretensions should give rise to
constant conflicts?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Everything concurs to shut in that rural world in
a vicious circle. Not only does the peasant lack
capital to improve his farming, but, assured of seeing
his rent raised if he ventured on the least improvement,
he is careful to make none. On his side the
landlord, for dread of annoying contestations, opposes
as much as lies in his power any amendment susceptible
of being turned into a title for his tenant.</p>

<p>Is there a succession of relatively good harvests?
He immediately raises the rent. Are the following
years bad? He refuses to return to the old rate, in
principle at least, because he finds it inconvenient to
curtail a revenue to which he has accustomed himself,
because he does not like to appear to bow before the
League, and also because, being liable to expropriation,
he is unwilling to depreciate beforehand the
value of his property, which is always valued according
to its rent.</p>

<p>Lastly, the holdings, being too often mere plots of
ground, are hardly sufficient to keep the peasant and
his family occupied, and do not always give him a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
sufficiency of food. And just because it is so, the
unlucky wretch does not find work outside sufficient
for the equilibrium of his poor finances. The
class of agricultural labourers can hardly be said
to exist in numerous districts, because everyone
is a small farmer. The tenant then becomes
completely sunk in his inaction; he becomes apathetic,
and from a sluggard too often turns into a
drunkard. His wife is ignorant and careless. She
can neither sew, nor is she able to give a palatable
taste to his monotonous fare. His children are pallid
and dirty. Everything is sad, everything is unlovely
around him; and, like a dagger festering in the
wound, the thought that all his misery is due to the
English usurper ever makes his heart bleed.</p>

<p>To all these causes of poverty and despair must be
added the general difficulties that weigh on agriculture
in all countries of Europe, the lowered prices of
transport, the clearings of land in America and
Australia, the awful transatlantic competition, the
disease of potatoes.... The picture being finished,
one thing only surprises—it is to find one single Irish
farmer left in the country.</p>

<p>These explanations, with many others, were given
me by a person that it is time I should introduce
to the reader; for he is the incarnation of one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
the essential wheels in the machinery of Irish
landed property—Captain Pembroke Stockton, <i>land
agent</i>.</p>

<p>The captain is a small fair man, of slim figure, of
military aspect, who received me this morning at an
office where he employs half a dozen clerks. The
room was lined with green-backed ledgers, or, to
speak more exactly, with rows of tin boxes, of a
chocolate colour. To-night he receives me in a pleasant
villa, where he takes me in his phaeton, drawn by
two magnificent horses. He may be about fifty-three
years old. His calm, regular-featured countenance
owes its peculiar character to the line that cuts
his forehead transversely, and divides it into two parts,
one white, the other bronzed by the sun; a mark left
by the English forage-cap, which is like a small muffin,
and is worn on one side of the head. The captain
has seen service in India; he fought against Nana-Sahib,
and even hung with his own hand a certain
number of rebels, as he not unfrequently relates after
dinner. He sold out when about thirty-five years of
age, at a period when selling out still existed (in 1869),
and got for his commission £3200, which, besides a
small personal competency, allowed him to marry a
charming girl, dowerless, according to the excellent
English habit; children came: means became too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
straitened, and, to enlarge them, he resolved to
become a <i>land agent</i>.</p>

<p>The land agent has no equivalent in France, except
for house property. He is neither a notary, nor a
steward, and yet he partakes of both, being the intermediary
between landlord and tenant. It is he that
draws up the leases and settlements; he who receives
the rents, who sends out summons, who signs every
six months the cheque impatiently expected by
the landlord; he who represents him at law, he
who negotiates his loans, mortgages, cessions of
income, and all other banking operations. In a
word, he is the landlord’s prime minister, the person
who takes on his shoulders all the management of his
affairs, and reduces his profession to the agreeable
function of spending money. The land agent naturally
resides as a rule in the vicinity of the estate.
Therefore he knows everybody by name; knows all
about the incumbrances, the resources of every tenant,
the length and breadth of every field, the price of
produce, the probable value of the harvest; all
the threads are in his hands; the landlord counts
upon him, approves everything he does, upholds his
rigours, and submits to his tolerance. Is he not himself
at his mercy? The agent keeps all his deeds of
property; has personally written out every one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
them; knows, in fact, a great deal more than himself
about it.</p>

<p>Let us premise that very considerable interests are in
question, and that the rents are ciphered by thousands
of pounds sterling. It is easy to understand that the
agent must be not only a man of honour, a clever man,
a business man, but above all a man presenting the
most serious guarantees from a financial point of view.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That is sufficient to imply that they are not counted
by dozens in every district; and that a land agent
provided with all the necessary qualifications must
before long govern all the principal estates in a
county. From his office, situated in the principal
county-town, he rules over ten, twenty, or thirty, square
miles of land, cultivated by five or six thousand
farmers, under some twenty landlords.</p>

<p>Thence the natural consequence that the same
policy generally prevails in all the administration
of the landed property in one district. The personal
character of the landlord may, indeed, influence
it in some ways, but the character of the
agent is of far greater importance. And thence this
other consequence, not less serious for the farmer, and
which gives the key to many an act of agrarian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
violence,—that in case of open war, in case of eviction
especially, it is not only an affair between the
landlord and the tenant, but also between the tenant
and all the landlords in his county, through their
one representative.</p>

<p>Has he been evicted? It will be well-nigh impossible
for him to get another farm in this county,
where he was born, where his relations are living,
where he has all his habits, all his roots, as it were.
And no work to be had outside agricultural work....
Emigration only is open to him,—which is equivalent
to saying that eviction must necessarily be followed
by transportation.</p>

<p>Let us imagine all the owners of houses in Paris,
bound together in association, to be in the hands of a
single agent; let us suppose that a dweller in one of
those houses is turned out of it for quarrelling with his
<i>concierge</i> or for any other reason, and unable to find a
house to live in; we shall then have an idea of the
state of mind in which eviction places the Irish
peasant. Let us add that this peasant has generally
built with his own hand the hut that is taken from
him; let us add that for him it is not only a question
of knowing whether he shall have a roof over his
head, but a question of being able to live by the only
trade he has learnt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>For many other reasons, the question of agencies
on a large scale still contributes to make the problem
more intricate.</p>

<p>In all affairs personal intercourse brings an element
the importance of which must not be overlooked. A
man will display the greatest inflexibility in writing,
who will hesitate to do so face to face with his opponent.
If the landlord knew his tenants, if he lived among
them, if he entered into their life and saw their
misery, very often, may be, he would recoil before
barbarous rigours, while the agent, by his very profession
is obliged to act with the precision of a
guillotine. The influence of women, so gentle and
conciliatory, is absent from the system. Pity,
sympathy, human contact, have no part in it. Can
we wonder if harmony be destroyed?</p>

<p>Examples are not wanting to show that a different
system, a policy of gentleness, of direct and mutual
concessions, and well directed efforts, bear very
different results. I shall quote as an instance the
case of an English lady, Miss Sherman Crawford,
who bought, some twenty years ago, at a legal sale,
a small half-ruined estate in Ireland. She went to
live on it, and began by giving her ten or twelve
tenants a written promise that they would get the
benefit of all their improvements without having cause<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
to fear that the rent should be raised. Then she made
it a rule that everyone should come directly to her in
case of difficulties, and not to an agent.</p>

<p>She built a few sheds, repaired two or three cottages,
on occasions lent a five pound note to facilitate the
buying of a cow or pig. That was enough. In spite
of the difference in race, religion, and language, she
and her peasantry are on perfect terms with each
other; her property of Timoleague thrives in the
midst of general poverty and wretchedness; not an
inch of ground lies uncultivated; the soil is well
manured, well drained, well used; the people are
happy and contented. To perform that miracle, all
that was wanted was a little willingness, a little good
management and gentleness.</p>

<p>But then Miss Crawford’s property is neither too
large nor too small. She brings there the capital
needed, and allows it to circulate in the place. She
sees everything with her own eyes, not with the eyes
of an agent. She is not the titulary of an entailed
estate, and has not given up its income to usurers.
Her farms are large enough to allow her tenants to
find their sustenance on them, for themselves and
their families. In a word, her property is in everything
the reverse of what is seen in all other parts of
the island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>And in truth, if delirious legislators had proposed
to themselves the task of inventing a system of landed
property that would give neither security to the
owner nor peace to the tenant, where could they have
succeeded better than with the Irish system? It is
at once stupid and ferocious, absurd and monstrous.
How true, alas! that human genius, so well able sometimes
to profit by natural forces, excels also in
sterilizing them, in making them homicides!</p>

</div>

<p>Before setting foot in this country your notions
are not unfrequently ready made about the characters
of the inhabitants. You have gathered them from
miscellaneous reading, novel-reading mostly, and what
you expect is an Ireland poor certainly, but nevertheless
gay, improvident, chivalrous, addicted to sound
drinking, good eating, fond of practical jokes, not
unmixed with riot and even blows; an Ireland, in
short, such as Charles Lever and Carleton, Banim and
Maxwell, Sam Lover and Thackeray have described;
an Ireland where wit and humour are to be met at
every step, where the last beggar has his little joke,
where originality of thought, unexpectedness of action,
fun inexhaustible, combine to form that eccentricity of
manner which is ever associated with the idea of an
Irishman.</p>

<p>That such an Ireland was, not long ago, a reality,
one cannot doubt. A whole literature, a rich<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
collection of tales, novels and legends is there to witness
to the fact. Its historical existence is as scientifically
demonstrated as that of our “Régence.” The
worldly exploits of the Duke of Richelieu are not
better proved. But it is in vain you look to-day for
that gay and careless Ireland; from Cape Clear to
Malin Head, from Dublin to Galway, there is no
vestige of it. She is dead and gone. Like Mr. Credit,
bad payers have killed her. Between her and us there
has been a great financial cataclysm where she has
been wrecked: the <i>crash</i> of the great famine of 1846-1847.</p>

<p>Never did she rise from it. Forty years ago she
contrived to exist somehow. The tenants were poor,
to be sure, but the landlords were not, and they spent
their money grandly. They led the usual life of rich
country gentlemen, had large retinues of servants and
horses, kept playing, drinking, and betting till they
had only debts left, which course had at least the advantage
of permitting their cash to circulate about
the country. The local traffic was relatively large
then. Butchers, coach-makers, wine-merchants, and
horse-dealers made rapid fortunes. Few towns in
Europe showed so much animation as Dublin, now
so empty and so dull a place. Everybody was in
debt with everybody; not one property was not mortgaged.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
It was the fashion at that time to pay only at
the last extremity. A general complicity gave force
of law to that habit. Lawsuits, of course, were plentiful,
but what is there in a lawsuit to prevent a jolly
squire from drinking hard, riding his horses at a
break-neck pace, or galloping from morning till night
behind his hounds?</p>

<p>Then came the potato-disease; then the famine,
which brought in two years a general liquidation.
Everyone awoke to find himself ruined; there were in
six months fifty thousand evictions. The largest fortunes,
when they escaped the Encumbered Estates
Court, established in 1849, remained loaded with such
heavy burdens that the income of the titulary fell to
nothing. One was obliged to pinch then, to sell the
horses, and shut up the kennel. There was an end to fun,
and if there remained here and there some inveterate
boon companion who would not give up the good old
customs, the <i>Moonlighters</i> soon brought him to reason,
poisoning his dogs and hunters, confiscating his
arms, and at times mistaking the landlord for the game.</p>

<p>There is no vestige left now of the easy-going ways
of old. The large town-houses and country seats are
deserted or let to strangers; the cellar is empty, the
dining-room silent. A gust of hatred and misery has
blown on the isle and left all hearts frozen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>As for the peasant, the poor creature has too many
cares for thinking of a joke now. Perhaps in other
climes, under a clearer sky and warmer sun, he would
revive, and find in his very distress the element for
some witticism. But here, the damp atmosphere, united
with persevering ill-fortune, has deluged and drowned
for ever his Celtic good-humour. Hardly does he find
now and then a glimpse of it at the bottom of an ale-jug
or in the tumult of some election riot. If a quick
repartee, one of his characteristic sallies, escapes him
now, it is always bitter, and reminds you of the acrid
genius of Swift.</p>

<p>“How deliciously pure and fresh is the air in Dublin,”
said Lady Carteret, the Lord Lieutenant of
Ireland’s wife, to the author of “Gulliver.”</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, Madam, don’t breathe a word
about it to the English. They would put a duty
on it.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And his terrible satire about the famous “excess of
population,” that favourite hobby of economists, who
has not it in mind?</p>

<p>“It is a melancholy object to those who walk
through this great town or travel in the country,
where they see the streets, the roads, and cabin-doors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by
three, four, or six children, all in rags and importuning
every passenger for an alms ... I think it is
agreed by all parties that this prodigious number of
children ... is in the present deplorable state of
the kingdom a very great additional grievance; and
therefore, whosoever could find out a fair, cheap, and
easy method of making these children sound, easy
members of the commonwealth, would deserve so well
of the public as to have his statue set up for a preserver
of the nation. I shall now, therefore, humbly
propose my own thoughts; which I hope will not be
liable to the least objection.</p>

<p>“I have been assured by a very knowing American
of my acquaintance in London that a young healthy
child, well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious,
nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed,
roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that
it will equally serve in a fricassée or a ragout.</p>

<p>“I do therefore humbly offer it to public consideration
that of the hundred and twenty thousand
children already computed, twenty thousand may be
reserved for breed, whereof one-fourth part to be
males ... that the remaining hundred thousand
may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the persons
of quality and fortune through the kingdom; always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
advising the mother to let them suck plentifully in
the last month so as to render them plump and fat
for good tables. A child will make two dishes at an
entertainment for friends, and when the family dines
alone, the fore or hind quarter will make a reasonable
dish, and, seasoned with a little pepper or salt, will be
very good boiled on the fourth day, especially in
winter.</p>

<p>“I have reckoned, upon a medium, that a child
just born will weigh twelve pounds, and in a solar year,
if tolerably nursed, will increase to twenty-eight
pounds.</p>

<p>“I have already computed the charge of nursing a
beggar’s child (in which list I reckon all cottagers,
labourers, and four-fifths of the farmers) to be about
two shillings per annum, rags included; and I believe
no gentleman would refuse to give two shillings for the
carcase of a good fat child, which, as I have said, will
make four dishes of excellent nutritive meat. Those
who are more thrifty (as I must confess the times
require) may flay the carcase: the skin of which,
artificially dressed, will make admirable gloves for
ladies and summer boots for fine gentlemen.</p>

<p>“As to our city of Dublin, shambles may be appointed
for this purpose in the most convenient parts
of it; and butchers we may be assured will not be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
wanting; although I rather recommend buying the
children alive, then dressing them hot from the knife,
as we do roasted pigs....</p>

<p>“I think the advantages, by the proposals I have
made, are obvious and many, as well as of the highest
importance: for first, as I have already observed, it
would greatly lessen the number of papists, with
whom we are yearly overrun, being the principal
breeders of the nation, as well as our most dangerous
enemies.... Whereas the maintenance of a
hundred thousand children, from two years old and
upwards, cannot be computed at less than ten shillings
a piece per annum, the nation’s stock will be thereby
increased fifty thousand pounds per annum, beside
the profit of a new dish introduced to the tables of all
gentlemen of fortune in the kingdom, who have any
refinement in taste. And all the money will circulate
among ourselves, the goods being entirely of our own
growth and manufacture.... Besides, this would
be a great inducement to marriage, which all wise
nations have either encouraged by rewards or enforced
by laws and penalties.”</p>

<p>The grim sarcasm goes on in the same sinister, pitiless
way up to the conclusion, which is worth the rest:</p>

<p>“I profess in the sincerity of my heart that I have
not the least personal interest in endeavouring to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
promote this necessary work, having no other
motive than the public good of my country, by
advancing our trade, providing for infants, relieving
the poor, and giving some pleasure to the rich.
I have no children by which I can propose to get a
single penny; the youngest being nine years old, and
my wife past child-bearing.”</p>

<p>Modern Philanthropy is not quite so bold as the
Dean of St. Patrick in suggesting remedies for the
relief of the sufferings of Ireland. Its great panacea
is emigration. The first thing which attracts the eye
in villages and boroughs is a large showy placard
representing a ship in full sail, with the following
words in large capitals, “Emigration! ... free
passage to Canada, Australia, New Zealand! ...
free passage and a premium to emigrants for Queensland!...”</p>

<p>Technical particulars follow; the agents’ addresses,
the names of the outward-bound ships, &amp;c....
These placards are everywhere. At each turning, on
every wall they stare you in the face, and fascinate
the starving man. Numerous and powerful emigration
companies paid by colonies where hands are
wanting, patronized by all that is influential in the
kingdom, work unremittingly in recruiting that army
of despair for a voluntary transportation. And thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
a continuous stream of Irishmen is ebbing out through
all the pores of the country.</p>

<p>Shall we give the official figures? There are none
given unfortunately for the years between 1847 and
1851, corresponding to the “famine clearances” or
famine evictions. All that is known is that at that
time the population of Ireland suddenly decreased by
one million six hundred and twenty-two thousand inhabitants,
without it being possible to say how many
had died of starvation, how many had embarked pell-mell
on hundreds of ships, how many had perished
at sea, how many had survived. Since 1851
the accounts are clear. It is known that 148,982
emigrants left Ireland in the eight last months
of that year; 189,092 in 1852; 172,829 in 1853;
139,312 in 1854. During the following years the
emigration slackens its pace by degrees and falls to
the rate of 75,000 heads a year. It rises again in
1863-64, and attains the figure of over 105,000.
Then it settles again to its level: 60,000, where for a
time it remains stationary. Since 1880 it has risen
again to 95,000, and over 100,000.</p>

<p>Within thirty years, the period included between the
1st of May, 1851, and the 1st of May, 1881, Ireland has
lost through emigration alone <i>two million five hundred
and thirty-six thousand six hundred and twenty-seven</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
of her children. The total for the last five years
has not yet been published, but it certainly reaches
half a million. From the year 1851, therefore, at
least <i>three million</i> Irish people of both sexes have left
the island, that is to say, nearly the half of a population
then reduced to six-and-a-half million souls.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Has, at least, the result of that frightful exodus been
to eradicate pauperism? One would like to believe it.
Theorists had promised it. But alas! stern statistics
are there to answer their fallacies.</p>

<p>Statistics inform us that the Ireland of 1887, with
its present population, inferior to that of London, is
poorer than it was in 1841, when it numbered eight
million inhabitants. Twenty years ago the number
of individuals admitted to workhouses was 114,594
out of six million inhabitants. To-day it is 316,165
out of a population diminished by a third. In 1884
the poor who received relief at home were 442,289.
They are now 633,021. In other words, <i>one Irishman
out of four</i> lives on public charity—when he
lives at all.</p>

<p>Upon such facts, would you guess what monstrous
conclusion the votaries of emigration at any price
have come to? Simply this: that the blood-letting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
is not sufficient; that Ireland must be drained of
another million inhabitants. Such is Lord Salisbury’s
opinion. As if an area of 20,194,602 statute acres,
so favoured geographically, was not calculated to
nourish twelve or fifteen million human beings rather
than three! (This was the opinion of Gustave de
Beaumont, after Arthur Young.) As if the emigration
of every healthy and industrious adult was not
a nett loss for the country, just as is the guinea taken
away by any <i>absentee</i>!</p>

<p>Is not his exit a sign of strength and energy in the
emigrant? He was free to stay at home if he liked; to
shut himself up in a workhouse and live there at the
public expense. Has he not given by his very
departure the best proof that he is not a useless
member in the social body? What! you incite all
that is able and active to go away, keeping only the
weak, the old, the useless; to these you dole out what
is necessary to keep up a flickering breath of life, and
when poverty increases, you are surprised at it!</p>

<p>I bear in mind the reasons alleged by politicians.
Elizabeth and Cromwell have invoked them before,
when recurring to more drastic but equally vain
measures. But, here again, the calculation is wrong;
the eternal justice of things has not permitted it to
succeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>For all those whom the feudal system starves out
of their native island take care, for the most part,
not to go and fertilize with their work the British
colonies. Vainly does the emigration agent offer
them a free passage, grants of land, and even premiums
in money. They prefer buying with their last
penny a ticket which opens a free land to them. They
go to the United States, where they thrive almost
to a miracle, and this is a decisive answer to the
masters of their race, who are also its calumniators.
They multiply there so as to form already a fifth part
(twelve millions) of the total population of the great
American Republic. At the bar, in the press, in all
liberal professions, they are a majority, and by their
brilliant qualities, which often secure them the first
rank, they exercise a real preponderance. But they
never forget that they are Irish. They keep the unimpaired
remembrance of their beloved country, dear
to their heart in proportion as she is unhappy. They
remember their home burnt to the ground, the old
grandfather thrown on the road-side, the little ones
crying at the withered breast of a pallid mother, the
wrench of parting, the heart-rending farewell; then
the contumely during the voyage—the hardships
after the landing; and they swear an oath that all
shall be paid some day, and, in the meanwhile, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
contribute their dollars to the healing of an ever-bleeding
wound.</p>

<p>It is there that Fenianism was born. From their
ranks come those conspirators who terrorize England
with their periodic outrages. In all agrarian
violence the hand of the emigrants is to be found.
From 1848 to 1864 they have sent thirteen million
pounds to those of their family that have remained in
Ireland; and, from 1864 to 1887, perhaps double
that sum. But in those figures, given by Lord
Dufferin, the secret funds brought to the service of
an ever-increasing agitation are not reckoned. The
<i>Invincibles</i> were in their pay. The <i>Skirmishing Fund</i>
was entirely sustained by them. The National League
lives, in a manner, upon their subsidies. When
Mr. Parnell went to visit the United States, they were
powerful enough to induce the Senate of Washington
to give him the honours of the sitting—an exception
which stands unique in history.</p>

<p>The independence of Ireland is their dream, their
ambition, their hope, their luxury in life. The day
when this is accomplished, England will perhaps
realize that the Irish emigration has been a political
blunder, as it is an economical mistake and a moral
crime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Cork.</span></p>

<p>Wishing to see some of those who emigrate I have
come to Cork. Cork is the great harbour of the
South of Ireland, the gate that opens on America
and Australia. From St. Patrick’s Bridge on the
Lee a steamer took me to where three emigrant
ships were at anchor ready to fly to other climes. I
went on board two of them, one English, the other
American. There was nothing particular to notice,
except an under-deck disposed as a dormitory, as
is the rule on board all maritime transports, so as to
lodge four or five hundred steerage passengers. These
passengers bring with them their bedding, which consists
generally of a coarse blanket, and the staple part
of their eatables. A canteen affords them, at reasonable
prices, all drinks or extras that they may think
fit to add to their ordinary fare.</p>

<p>The impression I gather in these under-decks is
rather a favourable one. There is as yet only the
bare floor, but it is clean and well washed. Through
the hatches, wide open, a pure and bracing air circulates
freely.</p>

<p>No doubt there will be some alteration after a few
days’ voyage. But it is evident that the Queen’s
administration keeps a sharp eye upon the emigration
companies, and sees that all sanitary prescriptions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
are observed. One sees no longer now-a-days such
scandalous spectacles as occurred in the years of the
famine, when thousands of Irish were promiscuously
heaped in the hold of <i>coffin-ships</i>, and died by
hundreds before reaching the goal. Emigration is now
one of the normal, it may be said one of the official,
functions of social life in Ireland—a function which
has its organs, laws, customs, and even its record-office.
The companies keep their agents in all
British possessions; they are informed of all the
wants of those colonies; they know what specialists
are in demand, what advantages are offered to the
new-comer. They do their best to make the offer fit
with the demand, and they seem to succeed.</p>

<p>An old boatswain on board one of the emigrant
ships tells me that life there is generally monotonous
but quiet. The passengers do not mix or associate
as quickly as one could imagine. Each of them
pitches his own separate camp on the few square feet
that chance gives him, and it is only after eight or
ten days’ voyage that they begin to club together.
The mothers tend their babies, the fathers smoke
their pipes, the children play, the young people flirt.
It appears that a relatively considerable number of
marriages are prepared and even concluded in the
crossing. There is nothing surprising in that, if we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
remember that the most numerous class of emigrants
is composed of marriageable girls and men between
twenty and twenty-five years of age.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A few types of emigrants taken at the inns and
public-houses on the quays. <i>John Moriarty</i>, of Ballinakilla,
County Cork, 45 to 50 years old. A rural
Micawber, dressed in a dilapidated black coat, a pair
of green trousers, completely worn out at the knees,
and crushed hat. A Catholic (he says <i>Cathioulic</i>).
Squats with wife and children in a single room,
almost devoid of furniture. Was to have embarked
five days ago for Canada. The Board of Health did
not allow it on account of one of the children having
got the measles (an illness which assumes in Great
Britain a most dangerous and infectious character).
Makes no difficulty to tell me his whole history.
Had a farm of thirteen acres. Was thriving more or
less—rather less than more. But for the last seven
years it has been an impossibility for him to make
both ends meet.</p>

<p>Strange as it may appear, the man is a Conservative
in feeling.</p>

<p>“Nothing to do in the country, with those <i>mob
laws</i> and agitation!” says he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>“What mob laws?”</p>

<p>“Well, the trash on fixity of tenure, fair rent and
the rest.”</p>

<p>“I thought they were favourable to the
tenant.”</p>

<p>“Favourable in one sense, yes, sir,” (<i>with a diplomatic
air, as he fastens on me two little chocolate-coloured
eyes</i>) “but disastrous in the end, because they allow one
to sell his tenant-right at a discount. You believe that
it will set you up, and it is the very stone that makes
you sink. The banks are our ruin, don’t you see?
Once they have taken hold of their man they don’t
let him out before they have skinned him” (<i>a silence,
then a sigh of mild envy</i>). “It is, indeed, a good trade
that of banking!”</p>

<p>He remains dreamy and seems to meditate the
scheme of founding a bank in Canada.</p>

<p><i>Martin Mac Crea</i>, 22 years old, a shepherd of
Drumcunning. A Catholic. A tall, pale, thin fellow,
decently dressed, with a wide-awake look. Goes to
Queensland. Why? “Because there is no opening
in Ireland. The most you can do is to earn your
bare sustenance.” It appears that in Queensland
it is quite a different affair. The profession of shepherd
pays there. Let a man bring or save the money
necessary to buy half-a-dozen sheep, and let them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
graze at their will. Seven or eight years later their
name is legion, and the man is rich.</p>

<p>“But are you then quite free of ties here? Don’t
you leave anybody, any relation, in Ireland?”</p>

<p>“I was obliged to live far from them, and where I
go I shall be more able to help them. Besides, the
post reaches there.”</p>

<p>“And the young ladies at Drumcunning. Do they
allow you to go away without a protest?”</p>

<p>A broad smile lights up Martin Mac Crea’s countenance.
A further conversation informs me that his
betrothed has gone before him to Brisbane, where
she is a servant. He is going to meet her, and they
shall settle together in the <i>bush</i>, keeping sheep on
their own account.</p>

<p>Let us hope she has waited for him. Queensland
is far away!</p>

<p><i>Pat Coleman</i>, twenty years old. A friend to the
former. Son of a small farmer with six children.
Nothing to do at home. Prefers going to the Antipodes,
to see if there is a way there to avoid dying
of starvation, as happened to his grandfather.</p>

<p><i>Peter Doyle</i>, forty-three years old. A journeyman.
A Presbyterian. Can’t find work at home; therefore
emigrates. Was employed on railway construction,
county Clare. Has been turned away, the line being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
completed and open to travellers. Had come to Cork
in the hope of getting work, but found only insignificant
jobs. Packed to Melbourne.</p>

<p><i>Dennis O’Rourke</i>, twenty-nine years old; of Enniscorthy,
Wexford. An engine-maker; belongs to a
class of which I had as yet met no specimen in
Ireland, the workman-politician. Has already emigrated
to the United States, where he spent three
years. Wished to see his country again, and tried to
set up a business on a small scale, first in Dublin, then
at Cork; but it does not pay. Goes back to New
York.</p>

<p>“Do you know why? I am going to tell you.
(<i>Fiercely</i>) I am going because this country is rotten
to the core! Because it has no spirit left, not even
that of rebellion! I am going because I will no
longer bear on my back the weight of dukes and
peers, of Queen, Prince of Wales, Royal family, and
the whole lot of them! I am going where you can
work and be free; where a man is worth another
when he has got in his pocket two dollars honestly
earned. That is where I go, and why I go.”</p>

<p>“In short, you make England responsible for your
misfortunes?”</p>

<p>“England be damned!”</p>

<p>It is O’Connell’s word. He was travelling in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
France, towards St. Omer, and found himself inside
the mail-coach with an old officer of the first Empire
who began forthwith to talk against the English.
The great Irish agitator kept silent.</p>

<p>“Don’t you hear me?” the other said at last,
insolently.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, I hear you perfectly well.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t mind my treating your country as
I do?”</p>

<p>“England is not my country; I hate it more than
you will ever do.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE LEAGUE.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ennis.</span></p>

<p>The county Clare, and more especially Ennis,
its chief town, have played an important part in the
contemporary history of Ireland. It was here eight
years ago (in 1879) that Mr. Parnell, at a great autumn
meeting, gave his famous <i>mot d’ordre</i> on social and
political interdict.</p>

<p>“If you refuse to pay unjust rents, if you refuse to
take farms from which others have been evicted, the
land question must be settled, and settled in a way
that will be satisfactory to you. Now, what are you to
do to a tenant who bids fora farm from which another
has been evicted? You must shun him on the road-side
where you meet him,—you must shun him in the
shops,—you must shun him in the fair green, and in
the market-place, and in the place of worship: by
leaving him severely alone, by putting him in a moral
Coventry; by isolating him from the rest of his
countrymen, as if he were the leper of old, you must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
show him your detestation of the crime he has
committed.”</p>

<p>Those words contained a whole programme, faithfully
carried out since, and which has already borne fruit.
They took exceptional force from the fact that Mr.
Parnell, at the time he pronounced them, was already
the acknowledged leader of Irish opposition. They were
in some sort the registration of birth of the League.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The League! Every moment, travelling through
this island, one comes in contact with this power,
mysterious though positive, anonymous and yet implicitly
recognized. The League houses and feeds
evicted families; it settles that such a landlord or such
a farmer shall be boycotted; it decrees that the rents
of such an estate shall be reduced 30 per cent.; that
of such another the rents shall be lodged in the League’s
own coffers; it patronises candidatures, chooses the
place and time of meetings, presides over all the
phases of social life. What is that League? is the
question one asks.</p>

<p>At first one naturally supposes it to be an electoral
association such as exists in every free country. But
little by little one perceives that it is a far bigger
affair. Electoral associations are not in the habit of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
inspiring such persistent enthusiasm, of covering during
eight long years the extent of a whole country; they
do not send roots to the most remote villages, nor do
they count among their members three-quarters of the
adult population. It is not their custom either to
fulminate excommunications, or if they do they have
but little appreciable effect on the ordinary tenour of
life. One never heard that they disposed of important
capital, and one would be less surprised to hear that
they had entered into a lawsuit with their printer about
an unpaid bill for five or six thousand placards, than
one would be to hear that they have several hundred
thousand pounds in the bank.</p>

<p>And yet it is precisely of hundred thousand pounds
that one constantly hears in connection with the
League. Where does it get all that money, in a
country worn so threadbare as this? Whence is it that
it is so universally respected, so religiously obeyed?
All the smiles are for the League, while the functionaries
of the Crown pocket only snubbings. All
the doors open before the League, while they close
and even barricade themselves at the bare mention of
the Lord Lieutenant’s name.</p>

<p>One observes these facts; compare and weigh them.
Then the conclusion imposes itself quite naturally
that the League is the only public power recognised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
by the bulk of the Irish nation. One already had a
suspicion of being a spectator to a revolution, of which
the violent deeds, instead of being concentrated over a
period of two or three years, as we have seen at home,
have spread over half a century. One understands that
one has fallen in the midst of a civil war, not in the
incipient state, but fully let loose, and that there exists
in this island two rival authorities,—that of the Crown
with the bayonets on its side; that of the League,
possessing all hearts.</p>

<p>Ireland, it is hardly necessary to repeat, has been
in a state of rebellion since the beginning of the
British Conquest. But it has been in a state of
revolution only for a period of about forty years.
Insurrection betrayed itself now by individual but
constant acts of rebellion, of which one can easily
follow the succession through past ages, now by
collective risings like those of Thomas Fitzgerald in
1534, of O’Neil in 1563, of Desmond in 1579, of
Preston in 1642, of the Whiteboys in 1791, of the
Oakboys in 1762, of the Steelboys in 1768, of Wolfe
Tone in the course of the French Revolution, of
Emmet in 1803, the New Whiteboys in 1807, of
John Mitchell in 1848, of the Fenians in 1865 and
1867. As for the agrarian revolution, born of an
economical situation impossible to bear, it follows its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
course as regularly as a great river, ever getting
larger and larger, widening its bed, swelling its volume
with all the streams it meets, increasing in power at
the same time that its waters get more depth and
breadth. Even the soothing mixtures prescribed for
it by the Parliamentary doctors have served as its
tributaries. Its torrent has at length become irresistible.</p>

<p>To discover its source, we must go back to the
famine evictions of 1847. The heart-rending spectacle
then presented by Ireland made it natural to look for
a palliation to such misery. The malady was studied
in all its aspects; much learned discussion took place
at the bedside of the agonizing patient. It was the
time when Disraeli developed his famous theory of
“the three profits.” The land, if one was to believe
him, must yield profit to three persons:—the Queen,
the landlord, and the tenant. It appears this was
arranged from the end of Time by the Great Architect
of the Universe. The laws of Kepler are not
more absolute. The unlucky thing is that the earth
does not always fulfil its obligations, and too often
refuses to yield up the three sacramental profits.</p>

<p>Theorists endowed with less boldness thought to
find a remedy by giving legal consecration to the
tenant’s rights by the system of <i>the three F’s</i>, as it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
was called, that is to say, <i>Fair Rent, Fixity of Tenure,
and Free Sale</i>. Through endless resistance, after
endless debating in the course of twenty parliamentary
sessions, a whole <i>remedial</i> legislation came
to add its bulk to the already so intricate structure of
Anglo-Saxon law.</p>

<p>Now the custom of Ulster was extended to the
whole of Ireland, and the right of the farmer over
the improvements paid with his money became law
(1860); now he was promised an indemnity in case of
eviction, and the basis was laid of a system of
amortization which must infallibly in the course of
time have ended in creating a class of peasant landowners
(1870).</p>

<p>Already in the year 1849, the State had interfered
between the landlords in difficulties and their
tenants, by the creation of a special tribunal for
obligatory liquidation,—<i>the Encumbered Estates Court</i>.
It finally came to interfere between landlord and
tenant by instituting a new court of arbitration, the
<i>Land Court</i>, entrusted with the care of fixing the
“fair” rent in each case.</p>

<p>That Court was no sooner opened than 75,807
affairs were inscribed upon its roll. It judged in one
year 15,676. But there remained still 60,101 to be
judged, and already the reductions of 18 to 27 per<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
cent. imposed on the landlords appeared insufficient;
already the farmers were loudly clamouring for
further reductions.</p>

<p>For in truth such remedies were too anodine for
such rooted disease! But the wedge had nevertheless
entered the tree. The State had appeared
in the character of umpire between the landlord
and the peasant. Henceforth all was or seemed
possible.</p>

<p>The essence of dogmas is to suffer no questioning.
One cannot with impunity discuss for twenty
years the basis of landed property’s law and the
theory of “the three profits” before empty stomachs.
As a parallel to these debates, the question of political
rights for Ireland rose again, and ended insensibly
by the conquest of the electoral franchise, of religious
equality, and of national education. The moment
arrived when the bulk of the population took an interest
only in the truly vital question,—that of the soil.
And all of a sudden they understood that there
was only one remedy for the ills that weighed so
grievously over them: Landlords and tenants cannot
continue to live side by side. Either the one or the
other must go.</p>

<p>“Let the landlords decamp! They do not belong
here,” said the peasants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>“No, by G⸺! The peasants shall go,” answered
the landlords; “the way is open....”</p>

<p>It was thus that towards 1876 the Irish movement
became agrarian, from being purely national. The
League is the organ of that new function.</p>

<p>Its primary idea belongs to two veterans of the
Fenian plots, Michael Davitt and John Devoy. But
what distinguishes it from those plots, besides a
broader basis and larger aims, is that it acts in broad
daylight, with face uncovered, appealing to all men
of goodwill, using exclusively those constitutional
weapons—the right of meeting, the right of association
and coalition.</p>

<p>“The Fenians saw only the green flag,” wrote
John Devoy. “The men of to-day perceive that
under its folds is the Irish land.” Nevertheless, it
was to the remains of the Fenian associations that he
and Michael Davitt had recourse at first to lay the
foundations of the new association. They went to
look for them even to the uttermost end of America,
secured the co-operation of some of the most influential
members of the Irish emigration, then came back to
Europe, and summoned a great preliminary meeting
at Irishtown.</p>

<p>As ordinarily enough happens in such cases,
their project was at first looked upon coldly by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
members of Parliament, who thought it impolitic,
and violently opposed by the secret societies—Fenians
or Ribbonmen—who thought it calculated to cool
the Nationalist zeal. But under the too real sufferings
produced by two years of famine (1876-1877),
the agrarian tempest assumed such formidable proportions,
that all resistance had to cease, and the
politicians were compelled to lower their flag. For
the chiefs of the autonomist party it was a question
of no less than keeping or losing their mandate.
Either they would adopt the new evangel, or they
would be left lying, officers without troops, on the
electoral battle-field. Most of them understood this
in time.</p>

<p>Mr. Parnell, the most conspicuous of all, had till
then limited his part to the demand for a national
government for Ireland, and his tactics to parliamentary
obstruction. From an economical point of
view he still remained, with all his party, on the level
of worthy Mr. Butt’s <i>three F’s</i>. He was one of the
first to understand that it was all over with Home
Rule, and with his own political fortune, if he hesitated
any longer to plunge into deeper waters.</p>

<p>He made his plunge with characteristic resolution.
“There is no longer any possibility of conciliation
between landlord and tenant,” he said. “Since the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
one or the other must go out, it is better that the
less numerous class should be the one to do it.” On
the 8th of June, 1879, at Westport, he pronounced
his famous, “Keep a firm grip on your homesteads!”
From the 21st of October following the agrarian
League promulgated circulars, which he signed as
president.</p>

<p>The League’s aim and watchword were—<i>The
land for the peasant!</i> Its means were the union
of all the rural forces, the formation of a resistance
fund for evicted farmers, the strike of tenants
with a view to compelling the landlords to grant a
reduction of rent; and incessant agitation in favour
of a law for the liquidation of landed property, which
would give the land into the hands of the cultivators
by means of partial payments made during a certain
number of years.</p>

<p>The success of such a programme, seconded by the
political leaders of Ireland, was certain. But its
promoters never had dared to hope for a rush such as
was experienced in a few weeks’ time. Adhesions
poured in by thousands; all the social classes embraced
it. The Catholic clergy themselves, after
wavering one moment, found it advisable to follow in
the footsteps of the revolutionary party, as the
Deputies had done before them. Everywhere local<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
boards were formed which put themselves at the
disposal of the central committee. Almost everywhere
the Catholic priest, his curates, not unfrequently
the Anglican priest himself, were found among the
members of the board.</p>

<p>This is enough to show with what alacrity and
unanimity the mobilisation of the agrarian army was
effected. Far from weakening the Nationalist party,
as was feared by its prebendaries, it came out of this
tempered afresh, enlarged, associated with the every-day
interests, tied indissolubly henceforth, for the
majority of an agricultural population, to the most
secret if the most ardent wish of their labourers’
heart.</p>

<p>What remained to do was to endow the League with
the resources wanted to carry out its programme; but
it was not in a country practically ruined, a prey to
the tortures of hunger, literally reduced to beggary,
that those resources were to be found. Mr. Parnell
set out for the land of dollars. He preached the new
word there with complete success. Exotic branches
of the League were established in the various States of
America, in Canada, and Australia; the only thing
remaining to do was to organize the <i>in partibus
infidelium</i> government that was to take in hand the
direction of Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>But a short time since this government sat in a
palace of the finest street in Dublin—Sackville Street.
There it had its offices, reception rooms, council-room
furnished with the orthodox green baize table,
its ministerial departments, secretaries and writers,
officially headed paper, its stamp, documents, accounts
and red tape.</p>

<p>After a recent movement on the offensive on the
part of the enemy, the League had to decamp and put
all this material in a place of safety. But though it
be presently without a known place of abode, the
League none the less pursues its work. Do not telegraphic
wires keep it in communication with its agents
throughout the length and breadth of the territory?
Why were Transatlantic cables invented, if not for the
purpose of opening permanent communications between
the League and its American, Australian, and
Asiatic colonies? In all the extent of its jurisdiction,
which is that of the globe, the League is obeyed and
respected; it possesses the confidence of its innumerable
tributaries.</p>

<p>Perhaps that comes from the fact that this committee,
though it sometimes accented too much the
professional character of its members, has at least the
rare merit of faithfully serving its constituents and of
being in perfect harmony of conscience with them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
Perhaps this is due to the effect of direct subsidies;
and we must see there something better than a mere
coincidence,—a great lesson for the democracies of
the future. One thing is certain: this government,
after wielding power for eight years, have their party
well in hand. They are able to do without red tape
or scribbling. One word is enough to indicate their
will, and if they lack secretaries, a hundred newspapers
will carry this word to its address.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It would be a matter of some difficulty to appreciate
rightly the financial resources of the League
Competent judges estimate them at an income of two
million francs. It receives on an average, from
English-speaking countries, a thousand pounds a
week. Now and then subscriptions slacken, and the
incoming of money is smaller; but the least incident,
such as a noisy arrest or a political law-suit, is
sufficient to awaken the zeal of the leaguers. That
zeal is always proportionate to the energy of resistance
opposed by the Cabinet of St. James to the
government of Sackville Street. If London so much
as raises its head, at once Dublin, and behind Dublin
the whole of Ireland, the whole of Irish America,
Australia, the Cape, and the extreme depths of India,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
all are shaken to their very centre,—in other words,
they pay.</p>

<p>The chief treasurer of the League, Mr. Egan, giving
account of his administration in October, 1882,
after a space of three years, stated that during these
three years £244,820 had passed through his hands.
In this total one-third only came from insular contributors;
all the rest came from abroad. £50,000 had
been given in relief of distress; over £15,000 had
been spent in State trials; nearly £148,000 had been
expended through the general Land League and the
Ladies’ Land League in support of evicted tenants,
providing wooden houses, law costs, sheriffs’ sales,
defence against ejectments and various local law
proceedings, and upon the general expenses of the
organization. A little over £31,900 remained to
the account of the association.</p>

<p>There are no reasons for supposing the normal
receipts of the League to have diminished much since
that period. More recently (in 1886) the “plan of
campaign” has created new openings for it.</p>

<p>This “plan of campaign,” one of the boldest conceptions
ever accepted by a great political party,
consists simply in lodging into the coffers of the
League, and for its use, the rents that were pronounced
excessive by its committee, and that the landlords<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
refused to abate. Let us mention in passing that the
Catholic Archbishop of Dublin publicly accepted the
responsibility of this tremendous war-measure. It
has, we must add, been exercised with obvious
moderation, in specific cases only, and by way of
example. The true weapon of the League, that which
it used most liberally up to the present day, is the
<i>boycotting</i>, or social interdict pitilessly pronounced
against any one who disobeys its behests.</p>

<p>From a legal point of view, the League has met with
various fortunes. Suppressed in 1881 by an Act of
Parliament, it was compelled to put on a mask and
to disguise itself under the name of the <i>Ladies’ League</i>.
A year later it underwent a new incarnation and
became the <i>National League</i>.</p>

<p>Now the Tory Ministry has suppressed it once more
<i>proclaimed</i> it, as they say (<i>clameur de haro</i>), in virtue
of the special power conferred on it. It appears
improbable that the health of the association should
suffer much for this; on the contrary, it will probably be
all the better for it. In former days it would have been
content to undergo a fourth avatar by taking the
name of <i>Celtic League</i>, <i>Irish Babies’ League</i>, or any
other name that would have done just as well to
deride its adversaries. A special provision of the
Coercion Act will prevent its having recourse to this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
expedient. By the 7th article of the Act, the Lord
Lieutenant is empowered to suppress any <i>new</i> association
formed with a view to continuing the affairs of
the old ones.</p>

<p>But one never thinks of everything. Precisely
because it is so explicit, the 7th article cannot apply
to the <i>old</i> Irish societies, different from the National
League, and which can easily be substituted in its
place. Those associations, <i>Home Rule Unions</i>, <i>Liberal
Federations</i>, &amp;c., are numerous through the country.
One of them could easily accept the inheritance of
the League, and it would be necessary to convoke
Parliament to suppress it. If Parliament suppresses
it, it will be easy to find something else.
And so on for ever, through ages, to the crack of
doom.... In the meanwhile there will be protestations,
agitations, interpellations, and before the end,
“the King, the ass” ... or the Ministry shall have
died, as La Fontaine said.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Lord Salisbury may close two hundred offices of
the League in the counties of Clare and Kerry. How
shall he close the offices beyond the sea, which are
the real ones?</p>

<p>In fact, the League is indestructible, because it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
impossible to get hold of it. One can arrest its chiefs,
as has been done often enough, intercept its correspondence,
oppose cavalry regiments to its public
demonstrations, and retroactive measures to its secret
acts; they cannot destroy the faith the Irish people
have put in it; they cannot grapple with the essence
of an association which rests on the most vital interests
of the peasantry.</p>

<p>Political persecution is fatally doomed to failure
when exercised in a free country, if it does not begin
by attacking the press and the right of meeting. And
who shall dare to touch those two pillars of the British
edifice? The English government is the government
of opinion, or it is nothing: now, the opinion of the
majority of Irishmen, of the majority of Scotchmen,
and of an imposing minority of Englishmen, is in
favour of the League.</p>

<p>To say the truth, all parties are agreed <i>in petto</i>
upon the necessity of abolishing landlordism. It is
only a question of settling who shall have the credit
of doing it, and how it shall be managed so that
neither the landlord’s creditors nor the public exchequer
should suffer too much by that unavoidable liquidation.
Therefore all the measures taken against an
organism that incarnates such general feeling can
only be an empty fooling, a holiday sport. Their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
only effect must be to awaken rural passions and
provoke new acts of violence. One might even
believe such was their only aim. For, to be able to
ruin a perfectly lawful association like the League, in
a country of free discussion, it is indispensable first to
throw dishonour upon it.</p>

<p>They have not yet succeeded in doing this, in spite
of the most strenuous efforts. Not only has it always
been impossible to charge the League with any act
contrary to the current standard of morals, but it is beyond
any doubt that its influence is especially directed
towards the prevention of agrarian crimes, and even
against individual resistance to landlordism. Wherever
there is popular emotion or possible disorder,
its delegates are present, and endeavour to enforce
respect for the law. If it happen that the orations of
some underlings overstep the mark, the general
methods of the League none the less remain unimpeachable.
It has taken for mandate the ruling of
revolutionary action, the legalizing it, the task of
giving it a scientific character. It is to its honour
that it has succeeded up to the present day. One
may reasonably suppose that it will not change its
tactics at the hour when its true chief is no longer
Mr. Parnell, but practically Mr. Gladstone.</p>

<p>From Kilrush, on the coast of Clare, an excellent
service of steamers goes up the estuary of the Shannon
to Foynes, where one takes the train to Limerick. It
is a charming excursion, undertaken by all tourists.
The Shannon here is of great breadth and majesty,
flowing in an immense sheet of water, recalling the
aspect of the great rivers of America. At the back
you have the stormy ocean; in front, on the right,
on the left, green hills dotted with snowy villas. Few
trees or none, as is the rule in Ireland, but a light
haze that softens all the outlines of the ground,
magnifies the least shrubs, and lends to all the view a
melting aspect of striking loveliness.</p>

<p>The boats are few in number, though the depth of
the channel would allow ships of the heaviest tonnage to
go up to within five miles of Limerick. I notice hardly
two or three sailing boats at anchor on this four
hours’ journey. What an admirable harbour for an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
active commerce would be that broad estuary, opening
directly opposite to America, on the extreme
point of the European continent. It is the natural
point of arrival and departure for the Transatlantic
steamers, which would reach New York in five days
from there. Engineers have dreamed of this possibility.
But to justify a maritime movement, and
legitimise such enterprise, a great commerce, an
industry that Ireland lacks, would be wanted. Gentlemen
of an engineering turn, come back again in a
century or two.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At Tarbert, where we stop to take passengers, a
fort opens its loop-holes, armed with guns, on the
river. Redcoats are encamping at the foot of the
fortress, and the morning breeze carries to us the
rough voice of a non-commissioned officer drilling his
men. One might imagine him addressing the <i>Invincibles</i>
across the ocean somewhat after this guise:</p>

<p>“Here we are, keeping watch: If ever this alluring
bay tempt you to come over, you shall find us
ready to receive you!”...</p>

<p>The helm trembles; the boat goes on its course,
and soon Tarbert melts behind us in the sunny haze.</p>

<p>On board, the travellers resemble those seen in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
summer on all great rivers—merchants bent on a
pleasure trip; judges and barristers, having taken
leave of briefs; professors enjoying their holidays, with
wives, daughters, sons, goods, and chattels—all have
the sun-burnt complexion and the satisfied look one
brings back from the seaside. They have been staying
on the beautiful shores of the County Clare, and are
returning home with a provision of health for one
year. La Fontaine has already noticed that, travelling,
one is sure to see “the monk poring over his
breviary.” Here the proportion is far greater than in
the ancient coach; it is not one priest we have on
board, but a dozen, all sleek, fat, and prosperous,
dressed in good stout broadcloth, as smooth as their
rubicund faces, and provided with gold chains resting
on comfortable abdomens.</p>

<p>One remark, by the way. When you meet an Irish
peasant on the road, he stops, wishes you good-day,
and adds, “Please, sir, what is the time?” Not that
he cares much to know. He is perfectly well able to
read the time on the great clock of the heavens. But
it is his own manner of saying, “I can see, sir, that
you are a man of substance—one of the great ones of
this earth—<i>since you have a watch</i>. My sincere congratulations!”</p>

<p>Well, all those travelling priests possess chronometers—we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
are obliged to notice it, since it appears
to be a sign of easy circumstances in Ireland—and
the rest of their attire fully carries out that symptom.
Under the undefinable cut that at once betrays a
clerical garment, their black coat has all the softness
of first quality cloth; their travelling bag is of good
bright leather; their very umbrella has a look of smartness,
and does not affect the lamentable droop that
with us is always associated with the idea of a clerical
umbrella. Some of them wear the Roman hat and
collar, with a square-cut waistcoat and the ordinary
trousers of the laity, and stockings of all the hues of
the rainbow. A young curate sports violet-coloured
ones, which he exhibits with some complacency. I
ventured to ask him, in the course of conversation,
whether he belonged to the Pope’s household. He
answered with a blush of modesty that he had not
that honour, and wore violet hose because he was
fond of that colour.</p>

<p>That is a matter of taste; but I have a right to
suppose, young Levite, that the mitre and episcopal
rochet—perhaps even the cardinal purple—hover at
night over your ingenuous dreams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Limerick.</span></p>

<p>Limerick is a big town of 40,000 inhabitants,
celebrated for its hams, lace, and gloves. The objects
of interest are an important linen factory, and another
for military equipments, besides a stone mounted on
a pedestal, and which served as a table for signing
the famous treaty of 1691—soon violated like all
treaties, however. Opposite that historic stone, on
the other side of the Shannon, the ancient castle of
King John rears its proud head; it has a grim and
gloomy look, with its seven towers, its thick walls and
iron-bound gates.</p>

<p>At the large hotel of the place I meet again three
of my ecclesiastical fellow-travellers. They evidently
know what is good for them, and would on no account
stop at second-rate inns. One cannot blame them
for it. But this is a sign of prosperity, added to all the
others; a hotel at fifteen shillings a day, without
counting the wine, seems at first sight suited to
prelates rather than to humble clergymen. Yet these
are only village and parish priests, as I gather from
the book on which I sign my name after theirs. At
dinner, where we sit side by side, I am compelled to
see that the appetite of the reverend fathers is excellent,
and that the <i>carte</i> of the wines is a familiar
object with them. They each have their favourite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
claret: one likes Léoville, another Château Margaux,
while the third prefers Chambertin; and they drain
the cup to the last drop. After dessert they remain
last in the dining-room, in company with a bottle of
port.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock that night, entering it to get a cup
of tea, I find the three seated round glasses of smoking
toddy.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>These memorable events are not consigned here, it
need hardly be said, for the vain satisfaction of
recording that on a certain evening three Irish priests
were tippling freely. They certainly had a perfect
right to do so, if such was their bent. It is the most
cherished privilege of a British subject; and of all
capital sins proscribed by the Church, drunkenness is
certainly the most innocent. But this remark, made
without prejudice, during a chance meeting at an inn,
carries out the general impression left by the Irish
clergy—that of a corporation greatly enamoured of
its comforts, endowed with good incomes, and whose
sleekness forms a striking contrast with the general
emaciation of their parishioners.</p>

<p>Everywhere, in visiting this island, one meets with
this typical pair of abbots, well dressed and well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
“groomed,” travelling comfortably together, and, to
use a popular expression, “la coulant douce.” It is
startling in this realm of poverty, the more startling
because the Catholic clergy have no official means of
existence, no salary paid them by the State. They
owe all the money they spend to the private contributions
of their admirers. Was there ever, they doubtlessly
think, a more legitimate way of making money?
That is probably why they make so little mystery
of it, and disdain to hide when they exchange part of
their income against a bottle of Chambertin. In other
places, priests think that a certain reserve is expected
of them; they prefer being securely shut in privacy
before they carve a partridge or plentifully moisten
a synod dinner. Here they are so secure in their
position that they recoil from no profane glance.</p>

<p>Their lives are, I am told, of exemplary purity. I
have no difficulty in believing it, both because purity
is a marked characteristic of the race, and because
their faith has seemed to me simple as that of the
Breton priests. There must be exceptions, and some
were pointed out to me; but assuredly those exceptions
are few in number. By many signs which do
not deceive those who have some experience of life,
one can see that the Irish priest has not the vices of
the Italian or Spanish priest. He is a gormandizer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
to be sure, but he is chaste—perhaps for the very
reason that he is so devoted to the pleasures of the
table. His simplicity of heart is wonderful sometimes,
and makes one think of those Mount Athos
monks, nursed in the cloister from the tenderest age,
and who know literally nothing of the exterior world.
I heard two of them, old men both, who were quietly
chatting in a corner of the railway carriage. Both
had small, bald birds’ heads, shaven chins, and a quaint,
old-fashioned look.</p>

<p>“<i>I am next door to an idiot!</i>” one of them was
saying, with curious complacency.</p>

<p>“So am I,” answered the other; “so was I always,
and I thank Almighty God for it!... for have
you not noticed that all those grand, clever people
often lose the faith?...”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Where does their income come from? That is a
question doubly interesting to us Frenchmen, who
every year pay out two million sterling for the budget
of public worship. A placard seen everywhere in
Limerick, and presenting a marked resemblance to
the advertisement for a theatre, will help to tell us.
This placard is to the effect that on the day after to-morrow
a general ordination of young priests will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
take place in the Cathedral of St. John, by the hands
of the Right Reverend X. O’Dyer, archbishop of the
town (the name and quality in conspicuous characters),
assisted by several other prelates and dignitaries.
It proceeds to state that excursion trains have
been established for the occasion, and that tickets for
the ceremony may be procured, at the price of half-a-crown
and one shilling, at No. 98, George Street.</p>

<p>This is a booking-office, exactly like those we have
in theatres. Plenty of placards, the plan of the church
showing the number and position of each seat, a table of
prices, and behind a little grated window a bearded old
woman for the tickets,—nothing is wanting. One has
only to choose one’s place, to pay the price down, and
to take away the ticket. About twenty persons perform
these various acts before my eyes. Evidently
the receipt will be good. The cathedral of St. John,
that proudly raises its brand-new spire above all the
others, must be able to accommodate at least three
or four thousand spectators. At 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per head on
an average, that gives already a total of two or three
hundred pounds. To this must be added the product
of the collections and that of the wooden money-boxes,
that open everywhere to receive the outcome of the
generosity of the faithful; the total, we may be sure,
cannot be otherwise than respectable. It is true that an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
ordination is not an every-day event, and that it must
be an expensive affair to put on the stage. We must
therefore suppose the ordinary income to be raised by
way of semestrial and direct contribution.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This is how the thing is done: each parish priest
has two Sundays in the year devoted to the taking
his <i>dues</i>, as he calls it. On these days, instead of
preaching, he exhibits a manuscript list upon which
are inscribed by name all his tributaries, that is to
say, all his parishioners, with the sums they have
paid into his hands; this he reads publicly. As a
rule he adds a running commentary to each name,
either to praise the generosity of the donor, or, on the
contrary, to complain of his stinginess. In the country,
especially, the scene is not wanting in humour.</p>

<p>“<i>Daniel MacCarthy</i>, four shillings and six-pence,”
says the priest. “That’s not much for a farmer who
keeps three cows and sold two calves this year. I
will hope for him that he only meant that as a preliminary
gift.... <i>Simon Redmond</i>, seven shillings
and six-pence; he might have given ten shillings, as
he did last year. He is not what we should call a
progressive man.... <i>George Roehe</i>, two shillings and
three-pence. <i>Richard MacKenna</i>, one shilling and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
three-pence. <i>Denis Twoney</i>, one shilling and nine-pence.
Against those who do their best I have
nothing to say. <i>Michael Murphy</i>, fifteen shillings.
Now, I ask, could not he have made it a pound?
The pity of it! <i>John Coleman</i>, five shillings. <i>Daniel
Clune</i>, five shillings. <i>Cornelius Nagle</i>, five shillings.
One would think they had agreed to do it.... <i>Henry
Townsend</i>, Esq., of Townsend Manor, three pounds
sterling. That’s what I call a subscriber! And
he is a Protestant. You ought to be ashamed of
yourselves to let a Protestant be more generous to
your own church than you are.... <i>Harriet O’Connor</i>,
one shilling and nine-pence. I will be bound she
liked buying a new bonnet better than doing her
duty. That is between her and her conscience. But
I am afraid that at the Day of Judgment she won’t
find it such a good investment.... <i>Mary Ann Cunningham</i>,
twelve shillings and nine-pence. If everybody
knew how to spare and how to use what they
spare in the same way as this good lady, things would
go better in this world and in the next, take my word
for it.... <i>Colonel Lewis</i>, of Knockamore Villa, five
pounds sterling. Another Protestant! Positively one
might think one lived in a parish of heathens when
one sees that the heretics alone seem to have some
regard for the church!...”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>The reading goes on in this guise, adorned with
reflections more or less pungent, and interrupted now
and then by a repartee coming from the far end of
the audience, and torn from the patient by the malignity
of the attack; a general hilarity is then provoked
without impairing in the least the reverence of the
congregation for their priest or their church. This
semestrial subscription, added to the weekly collections,
the daily masses, the baptisms, weddings and
burials, is amply sufficient to keep the church, the
priest, and the priest’s house in a good state of
repair. Most of the parish priests besides, have the
habit of “binage,” that is to say they often say two
or three masses a day, at different points of their
sometimes very wide parish.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They are generally addressed by their christian
name, prefaced by the name of <i>Father</i>: <i>Father James</i>,
<i>Father Henry</i>, etc., and this title well describes the
terms of filial familiarity of the flocks with their
pastor,—a familiarity not unfrequently manifested by
sound boxes on the ear for children, and good blows
with the stick on the shoulders of his grown-up
parishioners, but which does not preclude respect.
In the streets one always sees the parish priest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
respectfully greeted by the passers by; many women
kneel down to kiss his hand as in Italy or
Spain.</p>

<p>His authority is that of a patriarch, who not only
wields spiritual power, but also, to a great extent,
social and political power. He incarnates at once in
himself the native faith so long proscribed in the
country, resistance to the oppressor, heavenly hopes
and compensation for human trials. As a consequence,
his influence is great, for good as for ill.</p>

<p>The faith of the Irish peasant is entire, unquestioning,
absolute as that of a thirteenth century’s serf.
One must see on Sundays those churches crowded to
overflowing, and too narrow for the congregation who
remain, silent and kneeling, on the steps and even
outside the doors. One must see those ragged
people, forming a chain by holding on to each other’s
tatters, one behind the other, at a distance of 50 to
60 feet from the altar, a patch of dim light up there
in the darkness of the church; or else they must be
seen at some pilgrimage round a miraculous well or
stream, like the Lough Derg, wallowing indiscriminately
in the pond, washing therein their moral and
physical uncleanliness, drinking the sacred water by
the pailful, intoxicated with enthusiasm and hope.</p>

<p>The devotees of Our Lady del Pilar, and of San<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
Gennaro, are less expansive and less ardent. The
Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Rosary, St. Philip of Neri,
all the mystical armoury of the modern church have
innumerable votaries in Ireland. One would perhaps
experience some difficulty in finding there ten born
Catholics not wearing next to their skin some amulet
made of cloth or ivory, and invested in their eyes
with supernatural powers. If I do not greatly err,
St. Peter’s pence must find its more generous contributors
amidst those poverty-stricken populations.
To those imaginations of starved and half hysterical
people the Roman pontiff appears in the far distance,
all in white, in a halo of gold, like a superhuman
vision of Justice and Pity in this world where they
found neither the one nor the other.</p>

<p>An Irish servant in London once asked my advice
about the investment of her savings, some thirty
pounds which she had scraped together at the Post
Office Savings Bank. I congratulated her on her
thrift, when the poor girl told me, her eyes bright
with unshed tears:</p>

<p>“It is for our Holy Father, that they keep in prison
up there in Rome.... I mean to bring him fifty
pounds as soon as ever I get them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Those things may tend to explain why the only
prosperous trade in Ireland is the clerical trade.
Every year the number of priests increases, though
the population is decreasing. In 1871 they numbered
3,136; in 1881 they were 3,363, or an increase of 227,
under the guidance of four archbishops and twenty-four
bishops. The Catholic population is of three
million persons; that gives one priest for about 900
inhabitants.</p>

<p>It is generally admitted that each of these priests,
with his church and his house, cannot cost much under
£300 or £400 a year. That would give about
£1,200,000 coming annually from the pockets of
those labourers and servant girls. The tithe was never
so heavy.</p>

<p>This clergy is chiefly recruited from the class of
small farmers and peasantry (by the reason that
the other classes are for the majority Protestants); as
a consequence the clergy share all the passions of their
class. The agrarian revolution has no agents more
active. Almost everywhere the parish priest is the
president of the local Land League Board. In the
stormiest meetings is always to be found a village Peter
the Hermit, preaching the new crusade and denouncing
the landlords with fiery eloquence; not to speak of
the Sunday preaching, which is only another meeting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
closed against the police, and where landlords are
handled with extraordinary freedom of language.
One has seen Irish priests openly declare a shot to be
an unimportant trifle, so long as it was sent after a
landed proprietor. A few months ago a Dublin paper
mentioned a parish in Donegal, where the priest, they
asserted, had gone so far as to put the properties of
the landlords in lottery, by tickets of ten shillings each.
The verification of this fact would by no means be
easy. But, given the state of mind of the Irish priest,
the ardour he brings into the struggle, the boundless
indulgence he displays towards agrarian outrages, the
tale is by no means improbable; our Leaguers have
done even worse. However surprising may be in our
Continental eyes the spectacle of a whole clergy taking
part against the lords in a social war, under the
paternal eyes of their episcopate, we must remember
that here everything tends to bring about this result:—religious
passions, hereditary instinct, and personal
interest.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A priest who had the unlucky idea of pronouncing
himself against the League would soon see his subsidies
stopped. His flock would besides lose all confidence
in him, and all respect for his person. I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
told of a characteristic example of the kind of practical
jokes indulged in such a case by the peasantry against
the dissident pastor. A priest of the county Clare,
seized by sudden scruples, took it into his head to
abuse the League at the Sunday preaching, instead of
sounding the usual praise in its honour. At once they
sent him from the lower end of the church an old
woman who begged to be heard directly in confession,
before she could approach Holy Communion. The
worthy man, grumbling a little at such an untimely fit
of devotion, nevertheless acceded to her request with
antique simplicity, and seated himself inside the
confessional.</p>

<p>“Father,” said the old woman in aloud voice, “I
accuse myself of having this moment thought that you
were a wicked bad man, who betrays his flock to take
the part of their natural enemies....”</p>

<p>“Amen!” answered all the congregation in a chorus.</p>

<p>Without waiting for absolution the old woman had
got up to go. The priest tried to imitate her. Impossible.
They had placed on his seat a huge lump
of pitch which glued him, attached him indissolubly
to his place. To get him free they were obliged to go
for help outside, to call strangers to the rescue. The
whole village meanwhile were shaking with laughter,
and thought the joke in the best possible taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>The Irish clergy go with the League, both because
their temperament inclines them that way, and also
because it is an imperious necessity of their situation;
their case is rather similar to that of the <i>Home Rule</i>
members, who were compelled to enter the movement,
whether they approved of it or not. However strong
their hold on the mass of the rural population, their
influence would vanish in a week if they tried to pull
against the irresistible stream. Such sacrifices have
never been a habit of the Roman Church.</p>

<p>Indeed it is permitted to smile, when one sees the
Tory Ministry soliciting the intervention of the Pope
in the Irish crisis, and obtaining from him the sending
of a special legate entrusted with the mission of
bringing the Episcopate of Ireland back to less subversive
ideas. It is well understood that the Pope of
course sends his legate, and derives from his diplomatic
compliance all the advantages it entails. But
he is better aware than any one that unless he personally
gave away one million sterling a year to the
parish priests of Ireland, he would have little reasonable
hope of success in asking them to shift their
policy.</p>

<p>Is it necessary to add that the Irish priest himself
knows on occasion how to bring into his mundane
relations the traditional suppleness and prudence of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
his order? A priest of Wexford, actively mixed up
with the agrarian movement, was dining a few years
ago at the house of Mr. C⸺, proprietor of a large
landed estate in the county. Conversation turned
upon the League, and no good was said of it. The
priest listened in silence, without giving his sentiment
either for or against the League. All of a sudden,
with a look of assumed simplicity, he turned to his
host—</p>

<p>“Look here, Mr. C⸺,” he said, “Will you
believe me? <i>Me impresshun is that there is no Land
League.</i>”</p>

<p>The saintly man had for the last three months been
vice-president of the board of the Land League in
his district.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Galway.</span></p>

<p>Galway is an old Spanish colony, planted on the
western coast of Ireland, and which kept for a long
time intimate relations with the mother country.
Things and people have retained the original stamp
to an uncommon degree; but for the Irish names that
are to be read on every shop, you could believe yourself
in some ancient quarter of Seville. The women
have the olive complexion, black hair, and red petticoat
of the <i>mañolas</i>; the houses open on a courtyard,
a thing unknown in other parts of Ireland, as well
as in Great Britain; they have grated windows, peep-holes
in the door, and are adorned with sculptures, in
the Moorish style; the steeples of churches affect
the shape of minarets; the very fishermen in the port,
with the peculiar shape of their boat, sails and nets,
and something indescribable in their general outline,
remind you of the hardy sailors of Corunna.</p>

<p>The remembrance of seven or eight centuries of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
busy trade with the Peninsula, does not show itself
solely in faces, manners, or dwelling, it is to be
found also in local tradition. Among others, there
is the story of the Mayor Lynch Fitz-Stephen, who
gave in 1493 such a fearful example of ruthless justice.
His only son, whom he had sent to Spain to settle
some important affair, was coming back with the
Spanish correspondent of the family, bringing home
a rich cargo, when he entered into a conspiracy with
the crew, appropriated the merchandise, and threw
overboard the unfortunate Spaniard. The crime was
discovered, the culprit arrested, and brought to trial
before his own father, who was exercising the right
of high and low justice in the district, and by him
condemned to the pain of death. The general belief
was that the Mayor would contrive to find some pretext
to give his son a respite; and in order to supply
him with that pretext, his relations drew up a petition
of grace, which they presented to him, covered with
signatures. Lynch listened to their request, then
merely told them to come back for an answer on a
certain day he named. At the appointed time the
suppliants appeared again; but the first sight which
caught their eyes was the dead body of the Mayor’s
son hanging from one of the grated windows of his
house. An inscription, placed in 1524, on the walls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
of the cemetery of St. Nicholas, records the memory
of that event.</p>

<p>Galway is only a big borough nowadays, where
ruins are nearly as numerous as inhabited dwellings.
From the road that skirts the Bay, after leaving the
harbour, the long islands of Arran may be seen
rising on the west; from another road, which goes
northwards, Lough Corrib appears, famous for its
salmon fisheries. As an historic place, the county
possessed already the field of Aughrim, celebrated for
two centuries as the spot where James II. lost his last
battle against William III.—a battle so murderous
that the dogs of the country retained a taste for human
flesh for three generations after. But since the last
year it has acquired a new celebrity: another and no
less epic battle has been fought at Woodford in
August, 1886, for the agrarian cause. The account
of it is worth telling. Never did the character of the
struggle between League and landlord appear in such
a glaring light. All the factors in the problem are
there, each playing its own part. It is like a vertical
cut opening Irish society down to its very core, and
permitting to see it from basis to summit; a supplementary
chapter to Balzac’s <i>Paysans</i>.</p>

<p>Woodford is a pretty village seated on the shore of
Lough Derg on the slope of the hills which divide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
Galway from Clare. The principal landowners there
are the Marquis of Clanricarde, Sir Henry Burke,
the Westmeath family, Colonel Daly, and Lord Dunsandle.
Agrarian hatred is particularly alive in that
district; the Galway man is bloodthirsty, and counts
human life as nought. Five or six years ago Mr.
Blake, Lord Clanricarde’s agent, was shot dead,
and in March, 1886, a bailiff named Finley, a
veteran of the Crimean war, had the same fate
while he was going to proceed to an eviction on
the account of Sir Henry Burke. The spot is shown
still where the unfortunate man was murdered and
his corpse left twenty-four hours without sepulture,
nobody daring or willing to bear it away. A detachment
of the police in the pay of the Property Defence
Association having settled their barracks in the
vicinity of Woodford, the inhabitants, about one
thousand in number, organized a sort of grotesque
pageant, which made its progress along the streets of
the town behind a coffin bearing the inscription:
<i>Down with landlordism!</i> then concluded by burning
the coffin in sight of the barracks.</p>

<p>There are two churches, one Protestant, the other
Catholic. The faithful who attend the first are two
in number, no mere nor less, which would be sufficient
to show how legitimate it was for the Irish to protest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
when obliged to pay the tithes of an altogether alien
worship. The second is headed by a jolly compeer,
much beloved by his parishioners for his good humour
and liberality, Father Caen, a pastor of the old school,
whose boast it is that he keeps the best table and
cellar, and has the prettiest nieces in the county.
He is president of the local board of the League;
the treasurer of that committee is the <i>guardian of
the poor law</i> of the district, what we would call
“l’administrateur du bien des pauvres;” but the true
agent of the League—the <i>Deus ex machina</i> of the place—is
the secretary, Father Egan, curate of the parish,
an austere, thin, fanatic-looking man, a peasant’s son,
with all the passions of his race, who sucked the
hatred of landlords with his mother’s milk, and ever
remembers that many of his kindred have been
reduced to emigrate, and that an uncle of his went
mad after being evicted. A feature to be noted
down; that priest, tall, strong, sinewy, is an excellent
shot and an inveterate poacher. Nothing would be
easier for him than obtaining leave from the landowners
to shoot on their grounds; but he scorns the
leave. His delight is to lurk at night till he has shot
some of their big game, or to head openly a <i>battue</i>
for a general slaughter five miles round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One of the finest estates in the county is that of
Lord Clanricarde, to which are attached three hundred
and sixteen tenants.</p>

<p>Hubert George De Burgh Canning, Marquis of
Clanricarde and Baron Somerhill, was born 1832,
according to the <i>Peerage</i>. He was never married,
has no children, belongs to the House of Lords as
Baron Somerhill, is a member of two or three great
clubs, and lives in Piccadilly, at the Albany, a sort
of caravanserai (not to say seraglio), almost exclusively
a resort of rich bachelors. That is about
all that is known of him. His tenants do not
know him. The only glimpse they ever had of
their landlord was on the following occasion. In 1874,
at the funeral of the late Marquis, a man of about
forty, with fair hair, who had come from London for
the ceremony, was noticed among the mourners.
He was said to be the new master. That was all:
he disappeared as he had come. Save for that hazy
and far-away remembrance, the landlord is for the
Woodford people a mere name, a philosophical entity
of whom they know nothing except that he has a land
agent at Loughrea, a little neighbouring town, and that
into the hands of that agent they must pay every year
£19,634 out of the product of the land. The tenants
of Woodford are in that sum for about £1,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>The Marquis’s father died in 1874. Quite contrary
to the present owner, he was the prototype of the
Irish lord resident. Great sportsman, scatter-brain,
violent, extravagant, but kind and open-handed, he
was liked in spite of his numerous failings, and tradition
helping him he was emphatically the master
almost all his life long; a fact which he was wont to
illustrate by boasting that if it pleased him to send his
old grey mare to the House of Commons, the electors
would be too happy to vote unanimously for the
animal.</p>

<p>In 1872, however, the Marquis’s tenants took it
into their heads to cut the tradition, and gave their
vote to a certain Captain Nolan, the <i>Home Rule</i>
candidate. The irascible nobleman took revenge for
what he chose to consider as a personal insult by
raising the rent of all bad electors. He went so far
in that line that in 1882 the <i>Land Commissioners</i> had
to reduce them by half. That judgment could not,
of course, have a retrospective effect and bring a
restitution of the sums that had been paid in excess
during the last ten years, and which varied from £50
to £100. It may be imagined how they must weigh
still on the peasant’s heart, and what a well-prepared
ground the agrarian movement was to find at Woodford.
The successive murders of the land agent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
Blake and Bailiff Finlay were among the first and
visible signs of that ferment of hatred.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Those crimes, which remained unpunished, and the
responsibility of which is thrown at each other’s heads
by the two parties, came with the usual accompaniment
of fires, mutilations, verbal and written threats.
The reign of terror had begun in the district; no
bailiff was any longer willing to serve a writ or
assignation. There came a time when the landlords
nearly gave up all hope of finding a land agent to take
the place of the one who had been murdered; at last
they discovered the man—a certain Joyce, of Galway—a
man who united an indomitable spirit with the
most consummate skill; deeply versed in the art of
talking to the peasant, a fine shot, carrying his potations
well; ready for anything. A professional
exploit had made his name famous in the neighbourhood.
Having to serve writs upon several farmers,
and being unable to find bailiffs willing to carry them,
he made a general convocation in his office of all the
debtors, with the pretext of submitting to them some
mode of accommodation. The proposition being
unanimously rejected, Joyce gets up, goes to the door,
and after having turned the key, leans with his back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
against it; then, producing out of his pocket as many
writs as there were farmers in his room, distributes
them among the visitors. The poor devils were
caught; according to the terms of the law, nothing
but submission was left to them. It will not be unnecessary
to add here that Joyce, a born Catholic, had
been recently converted to Protestantism, which is
reputed an abomination in Ireland, and consequently
went by the name of the <i>renegade</i>. Such was the
man who came to settle at Loughrea under protection
of a special guard of constables, and hostilities soon
began.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The harvest of 1885 had been but indifferent, and
besides, by reason of American competition, the price
of the chief local products had fallen down considerably—from
about 15 to 20 per cent.—which implies
for the farmer an utter impossibility to pay his rent,
unless the nett profit he draws from the soil be estimated
above 15 or 20 per cent. of his general receipt.
Even in Ireland reasonable landlords are to be found.
Those who understood the situation felt for their
tenants, and, without waiting to be asked, granted a
reduction of rent. At Woodford, Lord Dunsandle and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
Colonel Daly of their own impulse, and Sir H. Burke
after some demur, gave up 15 per cent. of the unpaid
rent.</p>

<p>As for Lord Clanricarde, he gave not the least sign
of existence. When the November term came, his
tenants demanded a reduction of 25 per cent., upon
which Joyce declared that not a penny was to be
given up. This seemed so hard that it was generally
disbelieved; and an opinion spread itself that by
applying personally to the landlord justice would be
obtained. A collective address, signed by the 316
Woodford tenants, was accordingly drawn up and
presented to him.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Clanricarde vouchsafed no manner
of answer. Then, Father Egan put himself in motion.
He first obtained from the Bishop of Clonfert that he
would send a second petition to the master, representing
to him the true state of affairs, the reduction
consented to by the other landlords, &amp;c. Lord Clanricarde
did not even acknowledge reception of the
prelate’s letter. Let us state here, once for all, that
he never swerved from the attitude he had adopted
from the beginning, so aggressive in its very stolidity.
Never once did he depart from that silence, except
when he once wrote to the <i>Times</i> that, personally, he
did not object to the proposed reduction, but was in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
the habit of leaving to his agent the care of that sort
of thing.</p>

<p>Seeing that there was no satisfaction whatever to
be expected from him, the Woodford tenants imitated
their landlord, and henceforth gave no sign of
life, or paid him a single farthing. In the month of
April, 1886, Joyce resorted to the legal ways and set
up prosecutions against thirty-eight of the principal
farmers, whose debt was £20 and above, assuming by
that move the attitude of a moderate man who has to
deal with obvious unwillingness to pay.</p>

<p>And it was that which gave to the Woodford affair
its peculiar character, which made it a <i>test case</i>, a
decisive trial where the contending forces have
measured their strength, where the inmost thought
of the Irish peasant has shown itself in full light. If
the chiefs of the League had singled it out from amidst
a hundred (as, indeed, we may believe they did, whatever
they might aver to the contrary), they could
never have achieved a more complete demonstration
of their power. Chance, however, had also its usual
share in the turn which affairs took. Joyce, it
appears, had began prosecutions against seventy-eight
lesser tenants, and at the moment when success was
on the point of crowning his efforts, the procedure
was quashed for some legal flaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>As for the bigger ones, judgment had been entered
against them, and the execution followed. The first
step was the selling out in public court of the tenant’s
interest in his holding. Ten of the men capitulated
immediately, paying the rent in full with interest and
law costs, that is to say, about 80 per cent. above the
original debt. As for the twenty-eight others, fired
by political passion, pride, and the ardent exhortations
of Father Egan, they did not waver, and allowed
the sale to proceed.</p>

<p>Agreeably to the usage established since the League
has been supreme in Ireland, not one bidder came forward
at the sale. The representative of the landlord
therefore remained master of the situation, and got
for a few shillings the interest of the twenty-eight
farmers—interest which, in certain cases, was worth
£200 and more.</p>

<p>It now remained to evict those tenants from their
farms, and take possession in their place. Let us
remark that, being certain of having allowed the
landlord, through the sale, to help himself to a value
of five or six times his due, those men were bound to
consider such an eviction a gratuitous piece of cruelty.
Well knowing before-hand that the eviction would by
no means be an easy task, for all Ireland breathlessly
followed the course of events, Joyce singled out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
amongst the twenty-eight defaulters, the four tenants
for whom the eviction was sure to bear the hardest
character, namely, Conroy, Fahey, Broderick, and
Saunders. These were all people of comfortable
means, who had for many years been established on
their lands, who were profoundly attached to the
house where their children or grand-children had
been born, and which they had themselves built,
enlarged and improved at great expense; rural
<i>bourgeois</i> rather than peasants; men that in a French
country town should have been mayors, <i>adjoints</i>, or
municipal councillors.</p>

<p>For each of them eviction not only meant ruin, the
voluntary and definitive loss of a small fortune
laboriously acquired, and which could be estimated in
each case at ten or twelve times the amount of the
annual rent; it was, besides, the upsetting of all their
dearest habits, the destruction of home, the end of
domestic felicity. “Placed between this result and
the choice of paying £30 or £40, which he has in his
strong box, or which he will experience no difficulty
in borrowing if he has them not—what country-bred
man would hesitate?” thought Joyce. “Conroy,
Fahey, Broderick, and Saunders shall pay! They
shall pay, and after them the others must inevitably
follow suit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>This was very sound reasoning. But Joyce calculated
without the League and its agent, Father Egan.
The four chosen victims did not pay. With a resolution
that must really seem heroic to whoever knows
the workings of a peasant’s soul, Conroy, Fahey,
Broderick, and Saunders unanimously declared that
the agent might expel them by force—<i>if he could</i>—but
yield they would not.</p>

<p>Ah! there was a fearful struggle. It was not
without the most terrible inner combat that they kept
their word. At home they had the money ready;
nothing could be simpler than to go and pay it.
Now and then temptation waxed almost too strong.
James Broderick is an old man of seventy years.
One day, called to Loughrea by the tempter, he went,
in company with his friend Fahey.</p>

<p>“Now, look here, Mr. Broderick,” Joyce said to him,
“it goes to my heart to evict a good man like you
from such a pretty house.... You have lived in it
for these thirty years—it is the pearl of Woodford....
Let us make an arrangement about all this: you
pay me down your rent with for costs, and I
give you any length of time for the rest.... His
lordship will even give you back the tenant-right for
the price he paid himself,—fifty shillings.... Now
what do you say?”...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>Old Broderick wavered; he was on the point of
yielding.</p>

<p>“Indeed, Mr. Joyce, you cannot do more than that,”
... he uttered in a trembling voice, involuntarily
feeling for his pocket-book.</p>

<p>But Fahey was there. He took the old man’s arm
and drew him aside.</p>

<p>“It is not <i>time</i> that we want!” he said to him.
“<i>What we want is to uphold the principle!</i>”</p>

<p>Truly a great word. As fine as any recorded on
History’s page, for those who know how to understand
it rightly. If the peasants can remember a
principle when their property is in question, verily
one may say that the times are near being fulfilled!</p>

<p>All conciliatory means were now exhausted. It
only remained to have recourse to force. Joyce knew
better than anyone what resistance he was going to
encounter. Personally he thought he was going to
meet death. He went resolutely nevertheless, but
not without surrounding himself with a regular
army.</p>

<p>The bailiffs of the place refusing to act, some had
to be sent for from Dublin. Those bailiffs, escorted
by about a hundred emergency men, were supported
besides by five hundred constables armed with rifles
and revolvers. Woodford lies at a distance of about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
twenty miles from the nearest railway. The traps and
horses necessary to carry all these people had to be
sent down from Dublin, nobody consenting to give
any manner of help. The same thing occurred for
provisions and for the implements of the siege, pickaxes,
levers, iron crowbars, which were indispensable
to the assailants, and which were brought down with
the army to Portumna. These preparations lasted
three weeks. The mobilisation, decreed by Joyce at
the end of July, could only be completed by the 17th
of August.</p>

<p>On the next day, the 18th, this army moved forward
and left Portumna in a column, marching on
Woodford.</p>

<p>But on their side the Leaguers had not remained
inactive.</p>

<p>All the night long squads of voluntary workmen
had been hard at work. When the police caravan
arrived in sight of the village, they found the road
barred by trees and heaps of stones placed across the
way. They were obliged to dismount and go round
by the fields.</p>

<p>In the meantime, from the top of the neighbouring
heights horns were signalling the appearance of the
enemy; the chapel bells began to toll an alarm peal.
From all the points of the compass an immense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
multitude of people hastened to come and take up
their position on the hills of Woodford.</p>

<p>When the bailiffs made their appearance, headed
by Joyce, armed to the teeth, by the under-sheriff
whom the duty of his charge obliged to preside at the
execution, and leading on five hundred policemen,
an indescribable, formidable howl rose up to heaven;
the Irish <i>wail</i> which partakes of the lion’s roar and of
the human sob, of the yell of the expiring beast and
of the rushing sound of waters.</p>

<p>That lugubrious hooting was to last during two
entire days, with full-stops, <i>da capo</i>, <i>decrescendo</i> and
<i>rinforzando</i> of great effect.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The first house attacked by the assailants was that
of Conroy. It is a solid, comfortable-looking dwelling,
built on the bank of Lough Derg. To the
under-sheriff’s summons, the inhabitants, posted on
the roof, answered only by derisive laughter. The
door, which was of solid oak, was closed and barred
inside. The order was given to break it open. A
few minutes’ work sufficed to do it.</p>

<p>When it fell crashing under the axes, it was perceived
that a wall had been built behind it.... A
triumphant shout rose from the crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<p>“A breach must be made!” thundered Joyce. The
stone wall was attacked. Immediately, from the roof,
from the windows, poured a deluge of scalding hot
lime-water, which fell on the assailants, blinded them,
burnt them, and sent them back howling and dancing
with pain. Again the crowd applauded, saluting with
screams of laughter every ladleful of hot water that
took effect. The custom of Galway authorizes, it
appears, that singular way of defending one’s house.
<i>It is no breach of the peace.</i> One can scald the bailiffs
without any qualms of conscience or fear of consequences.</p>

<p>Nothing loth, the Conroy family freely used the
permission. The miracle was that they did not use
more murderous weapons. But the League’s agents
were there holding back, according to their custom,
the too fiery spirits, and keeping them within the
bounds of legal hostilities. At their head the priest
Egan was conspicuous, loudly advising the besieged,
pointing out to them the uncovered assailants, telling
them on what point to direct the effort of resistance.
As for the police, mute and motionless, they beheld
the drama without taking part in it. Four hours’
work were needed to make the breach. At last
the bailiffs were able to enter the house, expel the
inhabitants, and take possession of it. They were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
obliged literally to carry away the youngest Miss
Conroy, who desperately clung to the walls and furniture,
and refused to come out of her own will.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Night came, and the bailiffs have no right to carry
on their proceedings after sunset. They were therefore
obliged to postpone their operations till the next
day. What made matters worse was, that they must
necessarily go back to Portumna, for they need expect
to find no lodgings in Woodford. It is easy to
foretell the complication of events that now followed.</p>

<p>The whole of next day was employed in the eviction
of Fahey. That of Broderick lasted another
day, and caused the arrest of twenty-seven persons,
for in spite of the League’s efforts heads were waxing
hotter and hotter, and the combatants began to be
rather too excited on both sides.</p>

<p>But where resistance took a truly epic character
was in the house of Thomas Saunders. With twenty-three
comrades he held in check all assaults <i>during
four entire days</i>. Not content with scalding the
bailiffs by means of pumps and cauldrons installed
on purpose, he had, by a stroke of genius, the idea
of throwing on them hives of bees, that came out
enraged from their cells and cruelly stung everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
before them. Who knows that there may not be in
this a precious indication for future warfare! European
strategists may before long add “the chaste dew-drinkers,”
as Victor Hugo called them, to the pigeons
and the war-dogs. However that may be, Joyce’s
mercenaries, burnt, stung, and crest-fallen, were compelled,
for three nights running, to retreat on Portumna.</p>

<p>The green flag meanwhile was proudly waving its
folds on the summit of Saunders’ house, which
enraptured Ireland, intoxicated with joy at the news
of this unprecedented siege, immediately baptized
<i>Fort Saunders</i>. Agitation was fast spreading over
the whole country. The military authorities judged
it indispensable to send down 200 mounted men, and
to have the place patrolled at night. In Portumna
councils of war were held, and serious thoughts were
entertained of having recourse to the antique battering-ram
and “tortoise” in order to approach the
place and succeed in taking it. Three days passed
in new preparations and supplementary armaments.</p>

<p>At last, on the 27th of August, a new assault was
attempted. It failed like all the others, but the law
must, it was felt, at all costs, be enforced; the police
interfered about some technical point, took the house
at the bayonet’s point and made all its inmates
prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<p>Thus ended, without effusion of blood, this memorable
campaign; three weeks’ preparation, eight days’
fighting, a thousand men on foot, enormous expense
had been required in order to succeed in evicting four
tenants of the Marquis of Clanricarde, out of a number
of 316, and that in the midst of scandalous scenes
which gave the noisiest publicity to the agrarian cause.
Everybody was of opinion that enough had been done,
and evictions were stopped.</p>

<p>The affair at Woodford marks a date in the annals
of the Irish revolution. One has seen in it peasants
living in relatively good circumstances fight for principles
and go to the furthest ends of legality,—without
overstepping them. Moreover, these events have
taken place in a county famed for its violence and
represented in Parliament by Mr. Matthew Harris,
which is saying enough; (his motto was, till lately,
“When you see a landlord, shoot him down like a
partridge”). Three or four years sooner such events
could not have taken place without involving fifteen
or twenty deaths of persons. Here not a single one
occurred. One could not but acknowledge that the
honour of this was due to the League, to its moderating
and constitutional influence. In vain it protested
that it had nothing to do with those conflicts;
its agents and its general instructions played the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
part in it. Therefore it reaped all the fruits of this,
came out of the ordeal greater, surrounded with a
poetical halo, sovereign. History often has such
ironies. At the price of their domestic happiness,
four obscure heroes had just won in face of public
opinion the cause of the serfs of the glebe against the
lords.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PLAN OF CAMPAIGN.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Sligo.</span></p>

<p>In all the cabins I enter, the first object that meets
my eyes on the wall, besides a portrait of Parnell or
Gladstone, is, enshrined between the bit of sacred
palm and the photograph of the emigrant son, a sheet
of printed paper, sometimes put under a glass, and
headed by these words, “The Plan of Campaign.”
This is a summary of the instructions given by the
League to its followers in November, 1886, and of the
various means by which the position may be made
untenable by the landlords.</p>

<p>That order of the day of the agrarian army was,
however, absent from the house furniture of one of my
friends, Mat Cloney; he was a fisherman on the Garvogue,
near Lough Gill, and close to the ruins of the
Abbey of Sligo; an old man of hale and pleasing
countenance, whose weather-beaten face was shaded
by a plenteous crop of gray hair, and lighted up by
two wonderfully bright blue eyes: a true Celt in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
manner and appearance. When I entered his cabin
for the first time he was engaged in preparing his
dinner; this consisted of a dried herring and a cold
potato; but tearing down from a hook near the fire-place
a small piece of bacon, the old man hastily
rubbed it over a frying-pan, which he set on the dying
embers; in it he placed the herring. A great noise
and spluttering followed, then Mat, mindful of future
feasts, thriftily hung his piece of bacon back on its
hook, and the herring being done, sat down to his
meagre repast.</p>

<p>“You see, sir,” he said contentedly, “it gives it a
relish.”</p>

<p>I must not omit to say that poor as his fare was, he
nevertheless offered me a share of it. I explained I had
already lunched, and while he was discussing his meal,
we entered into conversation.</p>

<p>“You must be pretty well advanced in years,” I
said, “though one would not think it to see how you
manage your boat.”</p>

<p>“<i>Shure</i>, sir, I was <i>borren</i> in the <i>Ribillion</i>!”</p>

<p>Let me here observe that this is the common
answer given by many Irish peasants as to their age.
The “Ribillion” seems to have made an epoch in their
history, and they consider that any person over middle
age must have been born during that momentous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
period. The date appears to matter little to them. So,
though I entertained private doubts of Cloney’s being
89 years old, I let that pass, and we went on talking.</p>

<p>“Have you any children?”</p>

<p>“<i>Shire</i> I have!... Me sons they are fishermen,
and me daughters are all marr’d, near here....”</p>

<p>“And you live alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, that I do.”</p>

<p>“It must be a lonely life for you. Were you never
tempted to marry again after your wife’s death? A
fine man like you would have had no difficulty in
finding a wife.”</p>

<p>“Och, sir, after me ould woman died ... (with a
burst of emotion) I always remained a <i>dacent widowman</i> ...
that I did!...”</p>

<p>While we were talking I had been looking at the
walls of the cabin, and I was surprised at finding
none of the usual League’s documents upon them. I
turned to Mat and expressed my surprise. Instantly
Mat let fall the knife with which he was conveying a
piece of herring to his mouth, and burst into loud
execrations.</p>

<p>“Och! the b⸺ villains!” he exclaimed; “the
dirty never-do-well wh⸺! the de’il take them for
his own! ... the whole lot is not worth a pennyworth
o’ salt; ... etc., etc.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<p>I confess I rather wondered at this violence. But
as everyone has a perfect right to his own opinion,
I did not press the point.</p>

<p>“And you, sir, you be not English, are ye?” said
Mat after a moment. He had suddenly grown calm
again.</p>

<p>“No, I am French.”</p>

<p>“Och! <i>Shure</i> the French are foine fellows. I had
an uncle that fought the French for three days
at Badajos, and he always said they were b⸺y
devils, ... begging your pardon, sir, foine fellows
they were.... Me uncle always said so, ...
under <i>Bonney</i> the French fought, ... b⸺d ...
foine fellows, to be sure.... Me uncle also said
they had no landlords down there. Now, is that true,
sir?” added Mat Cloney, looking at me with a queer
expression of countenance.</p>

<p>No landlords? could that be true? He seemed to
consider such a state of things suited to fairy-land.</p>

<p>I explained that this was pure truth. In few words
I told him how, shortly before the <i>Ribillion</i> dear to
his heart, the French peasants had risen as one man
to get rid of their own landlords; how those landlords
had for the most part emigrated and taken up arms
against their country, which had caused the confiscation
and sale of their lands. I added that those lands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
were now the property of the French labourers, who
highly appreciate this state of affairs.</p>

<p>Mat Cloney listened to me, his eyes glistening with
interest. Therefore, I was rather surprised when I
stopped, and he abruptly asked me, as a conclusion:</p>

<p>“Do you know any of those Sligo gentlemen who
come fishing about here, sir?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I do not. I am a total stranger in these
parts. It was the manager at my hotel who sent me
to you.”</p>

<p>“That’s roight!” he exclaimed, as if relieved from
some anxiety. “In that case, sir, I am going to show
you something!...”</p>

<p>He went to a corner of the cabin, and after some
rummaging in an old sailor’s box, he produced from
it a neatly folded paper which he placed into my
hands. I opened it with some curiosity.</p>

<p>It was a supplementary sheet of the <i>United Ireland</i>,
of Dublin, where stood <i>in extenso</i> the League’s Plan
of Campaign.</p>

<p>I looked at Mat Cloney. He was laughing silently.
I at last understood the riddle. The sly fox was at
heart with the League (he dubbed it <i>the Leg</i>; by the
way, like many other Irishmen); but he judged it
prudent in any case to dissemble such subversive
feelings, when he had to do with an unknown person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
from the town; and being a peasant he rather overdid
it.</p>

<p>The ice was broken now. He let me study
thoroughly the document he had lent me, and even
enriched it with luminous commentaries, in the course
of a pleasant day’s fishing.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The “Plan of Campaign” seems to have had for its
father Mr. John Dillon, one of the most universally, and
the most deservedly, popular of the Irish members; at
all events, it was introduced to the public by that
gentleman in October, 1886, at an autumn meeting.
Those mass meetings, held every year after the
harvest, have now become an institution, a kind of
<i>Witena-gemot</i> of the Irish nation. People come to
them from the farthest ends of the island, by rail, in
jaunting-cars, on foot, on horseback, as the case may
be; in such numbers that there is no room or shanty
large enough in the country to lodge the assemblage.
So they are open-air meetings. The particular one
alluded to was convened at Woodford, which has
become, since the memorable battle on the Clanricarde
estate, a kind of Holy Place and agrarian
Kaaba. Soon after the autumn meeting, the scheme
was approved by the authorities, at the head-quarters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
of the League (although they prudently refrained
from committing themselves officially to it), and expounded
in the special supplement to the <i>United
Ireland</i>, of which I hold a copy. It was to the
following effect:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Present rents, speaking roundly, are impossible. That the landlords
will press for them is certain. A fight for the coming winter is therefore
inevitable, and it behoves the Irish tenantry to fight with a skill
begotten by experience. The first question they have to consider is
how to meet the November demand. Should combinations be formed
on the lines of branches of the National League, or merely by estates?
We say <i>by estates</i> decidedly. Let branches of the National League, if
they will, take the initiative in getting the tenantry on each estate to
meet one another. But it should be distinctly understood that the
action or resolution of one estate was not to bind any other, and the
tenantry on every estate should be free to decide upon their own course.</p>

<p>When they are assembled together, let them appoint an intelligent
and sturdy member of their body as chairman, and, after consulting, decide
by resolution on the amount of abatement they will demand. A
committee consisting, say, of six and the chairman, should then be
elected, to be called a Managing Committee, and to take charge of the
half-year’s rent of the tenant, should the landlord refuse it.</p>

<p>Everyone should pledge himself (1) to abide by the decision of the
majority; (2) to hold no communication with the landlord or any of his
agents, except in presence of the body of the tenantry; (3) to accept
no settlement for himself which is not given to every tenant on the
estate.</p>

<p>On the rent-day, the tenantry should proceed to the rent-office in a
body. If the agent refuses to see them in a body, they should on no
account confer with him individually, but depute the chairman to act as
their spokesman and acquaint them of the reduction which they require.
No offer to accept the rent “on account” should be agreed to. Should
the agent refuse, then <span class="smcap">every tenant must hand to the Managing
Committee the half-year’s rent which he tendered to
the agent</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span></p>

<p>To prevent any attempt at a garnishee, this money should be deposited
by the Managing Committee with some one reliable person,
<i>whose name would not be known to any but the members of the committee</i>.</p>

<p>This may be called the estate fund, and it should be absolutely at the
disposal of the Managing Committee for the purposes of the fight.
Broken tenants who are unable to contribute the reduced half-year’s
rent should at least contribute the percentage demanded from the landlord,
that is the difference between the rent demanded and that which
the tenantry offer to pay. A broken tenant is not likely to be among
the first proceeded against, and no risk is incurred by the general body
in taking him on these terms.</p>

<p>Thus, practically a half-year’s rent of the estate is put together to
fight the landlord with. This is a fund which, if properly utilised, will
reduce to reason any landlord in Ireland.</p>

<p>How should the fund be employed? The answer to this question
must to some extent depend upon the course the landlord will pursue;
but in general we should say it must be devoted to the support of the
tenants who are dispossessed either by sale or ejectment.</p>

<p>It should be distributed by the committee to each evicted tenant in
the proportion of his contribution to the fund. A half-year’s rent is
supposed to maintain a tenant for a half year, and based upon this
calculation, a tenant who funded say £50 would be entitled when evicted
to receive £2 per week.</p>

<p><i>But not one penny should go in law costs.</i> This should be made an
absolute rule. For to pay law costs, such as attorney’s letters, writs and
judgments incurred by the landlord, is to arm your enemy for the quarrel
and furnish him with provisions to boot. In a determined fight there
are no “law costs” on the side of the tenantry, and they should remain
out for ever rather than pay those which the landlord incurs in fleecing
them.</p>

<p>Ejectment is the most common of the landlord’s remedies. Every
legal and constitutional obstacle which could oppose or delay eviction
should be had recourse to, for every hour by which the sheriff is delayed
in one eviction gives another brother tenant so much more grace. There
are only 310 days in the sheriff’s year, and he must do all the evictions
in a whole county within the time.</p>

<p>If, after eviction, a tenant is re-admitted as caretaker he should go in,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
but <i>never</i> upon the understanding that he would care any other farm but
his own. Should the tenant not be re-admitted, shelter must be procured
for him immediately by the Managing Committee, and then, if
necessary, a day appointed when all would assemble to build him a hut
on some spot convenient to the farm where the landlord could not disturb
him. Wooden huts, such as those supplied by the League, waste
too much of the funds and become valueless when the tenant is re-admitted.</p>

<p>Sale is the resort of the landlord when he proceeds by writ or process
as an ordinary creditor. From eight to twelve days are allowed after
service of the writ before judgment can be marked. The sheriff may
seize cattle if he finds them on the farm, or he may seize and sell the
tenant’s interest in the farm. A tenant who has his mind made up for
the fight will have his cattle turned into money before the judgment
comes on. Every tenant who neglects to dispose of them is preparing
himself to accept the landlord’s terms, for he will not wish to see the
emergency men profit by taking his cattle at some nominal price,
and if he buys he is in reality handing the landlord the amount of his
demand. Sale of a farm is not of so much consequence. Every farm
sold in this manner during the agitation either has come or is bound to
come back to its owner even on better terms than he first held it. But
if a man has a very valuable interest in his farm, he can place it beyond
the sheriff’s power by mortgaging it to some one to whom he owes
money. Mortgage effected thus for a <i>bonâ fide</i> debt or consideration
bars the sheriff’s power of conveyance at a sale. If the landlord or
emergency men be represented, the cattle should not be allowed to go
at a nominal sum. They should be run up to their price, and, if possible,
left in the hands of emergency men at full price. It should be
borne in mind that if the full price be not realised the sheriff could seize
again for the balance.</p>

<p>In bidding for a farm it should also be run to amount of debt, but by
a man of straw, or some one who, if it were knocked down, would ask
the sheriff for time to pay. By making the landlord’s bidder run it up
to the amount of debt and costs, and leaving it on his hands, the sheriff
cannot follow the tenant further. No auction fees should be allowed.
A farm held on a lease for a life or lives, any one of which is extant,
cannot be sold by the sheriff. After sale a tenant is still in possession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
of holding until a fresh writ is served and a judgment for title marked
against him. All this involves the landlord in fresh costs. The eviction
may then follow, and the observations above recorded in case of ejectment
or eviction apply here.</p>

<p>Distress, another of the landlord’s remedies, cannot be resorted to for
more than one year’s rent. Few landlords can have recourse to this
without exposing themselves to actions. The chief points to attend to
are:—That distress must be made by landlord or known agent, or bailiff
authorized by warrant signed by the landlord or known agent; that
particulars of distress be served; seizure on Sunday is unlawful; seizure
before sunrise or after sunset is unlawful; or for any rent due more
than one year. Distress is illegal if growing crops be seized, or the
implements of a man’s trade; and if other property be on farm to
ensure landlord’s demand, it is illegal to seize beasts of the plough,
sheep, or implements of husbandry necessary for the cultivation of the
land. These points should be carefully watched when landlord has
recourse to distress.</p>

<p>Bankruptcy proceedings are too costly a machinery for general use,
and no landlord is likely to have recourse to them.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to add that landlords, and their partisans on the
magisterial bench and among the Crown officials, will do all in their
power to twist the operation of the law so as to harass the tenants.</p>

<p>A tenant taking possession of his house to shelter his family from the
severity of the winter is not likely to escape. A summons for trespass
must be preceded by a warning to the tenant if he be found in possession.
We have known a case where the father complied with this
warning, and on the bailiff’s next visit the mother only was found, and
she complied. Next time the eldest daughter only was in possession,
and so on through the length of a long family, such as an evicted tenant
nearly always has. A goodly time had been saved before the father’s
turn came again. He was fined and went to gaol. The prison then
lost its terror for him. When he came out he stuck boldly to his home,
and he soon won the victory which rewards determination.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The fullest publicity should be given to evictions, and every effort
made to enlist public sympathy. That the farms thus unjustly evicted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
will be left severally alone, and everyone who aids the eviction shunned,
is scarcely necessary to say. But the man who tries boycotting for a
personal purpose is a worse enemy than the evicting landlord, and
should be expelled from any branch of the League or combination of
tenants. No landlord should get one penny rent on any part of his
estates, wherever situated, so long as he has one tenant unjustly evicted.
This policy strikes not only at the landlord but the whole ungodly crew
of agents, attorneys, and bum-bailiffs. Tenants should be the first to
show their sympathy with one another, and prompt publicity should be
given to every eviction, that the tenants of the evictor wherever he
holds property may show their sympathy.</p>

<p>Such a policy indicates a fight which has no half-heartedness about it,
and it is the only fight which will win.</p>

</div>

<p>Well may the author of the “Plan of Campaign”
wind up his catechism by the appropriate remark that
“such a policy indicates a fight which has no half-heartedness
about it.” Never before was such a tremendous
weapon of social war put in motion. Never
before, in the whole course of history, was such a
forcible ultimatum drafted for the consideration of the
adverse party.</p>

<p>Leaving details aside, and the minute instructions
on the true mode of skirmishing with the myrmidons
of the law, the idea of using the very rent claimed by
the landlord as a provision for feeding the struggle
against him is in itself perfection—a real masterpiece
of strategy. An artist can only feel the
warmest admiration for such a combination of everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
that is most pleasant to the heart of the agrarian
warrior and most deadly to the landlord’s cause. As
an orator of the League (Mr. W. O’Brien) has put it:
“We have discovered a weapon against landlordism,
the mere threat and terror of which have already
brought down rack-renters to their knees. We have
discovered a weapon which feudal landlordism can no
more resist than a suit of armour of the middle ages
can resist modern artillery.” And the country where
such an admirable paper has been penned by its
political leaders is supposed by its foes to be unable
to rule its own affairs! This is unfairness with a
vengeance. Let those meet its provisions, since they
are so very clever.</p>

<p>The wonder, however, is not that such a policy
should have been dreamed of. Similar plans of warfare
have more than once been drawn out in the
council chamber of parties. The wonder is that this one
should have been deemed practicable by the farmers
of Ireland; that it should have been unanimously
accepted by them; and, what is more, put at once
into effect. Another wonder is that it should have
been found <i>lawful</i>, on the best legal authority, and
that it should have remained unopposed by the “Four
Courts” and “the Castle.” The greatest wonder of
all is that it should have enlisted the warm and public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
support not only of the lower ranks of the clergy all
over the island, but of the Episcopate itself; not only
of the Episcopate but of the Pope, since neither his
special envoy in Ireland nor his Holiness personally in
any encyclical letter, have spoken one word in condemnation
of the “Plan of Campaign.”</p>

<p>It has been in operation now for over one year; it
has spread as far as the leaders of the League have
deemed it expedient, for thus far they seem to have
used it only moderately. “We did not desire,” they
say, “and we do not desire now that the ‘Plan of
Campaign’ should be adopted anywhere, except where
the tenants have a just and moderate and unimpeachable
case.” But, none the less, it hangs as a formidable
threat over the heads of the doomed landlords. At a
moment’s notice it may be extended to the whole
island, as it has been already to some hundred estates
in twenty-two counties.</p>

<p>An idea of the state of affairs may be gathered
from the account given by the <i>Freeman’s Journal</i>
(December 3, 1886) of the scene witnessed on Lord
de Freyne’s property in county Sligo. His tenants
asked for an abatement of 20 per cent., and, being
refused, they decided to adopt the “Plan of Campaign.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There is nothing in the nature of a town or even a village at Kilfree
Junction, there being only two or three one-story thatched cottages
within sight of it. In one of these, the nearest to the station, the rents
were received by Mr. William Redmond, M.P.; the Rev. Canon
O’Donoghue, D.D.; Rev. Father Henry, C.C.; and the Rev. Father
Filan, C.C. The operations of receiving the rents, entering amounts,
and giving receipts to the tenants occupied the greater part of the day,
commencing in early morning and continuing far in the afternoon.
Although the situation was rather a depressing one for the poor people
exposed to all the severity of the elements, they seemed to be one and
all animated by the greatest enthusiasm. The interior of the cottage in
which the rents were being collected presented a spectacle really unique
in its way. The first room, a sort of combination of kitchen, sitting-room,
and shop, was crowded almost to suffocation by men and a few
women, who were sheltering from the snow which fell in great white
flakes without. There was no grate, but a few turf sods burned on the
hearth, while above them hung a kettle, suspended from an iron hook
fixed from the quaint old chimney. In the centre of the bedroom leading
off the apartment was a small table, at which Mr. Redmond, M.P.,
the clergymen whose names are given above, and one of the leading
members of the local branch of the National League were seated receiving
the tenants’ rents. The room was densely crowded, but the
utmost order and decorum prevailed, and the whole proceedings were
conducted in the most punctilious and business-like manner.</p>

<p>The tenant handed the money to one of the gentlemen at the table,
his name was duly entered with the amount paid by him into a book,
and he was handed back a printed receipt for the amount which he had
lodged.</p>

<p>As the day wore on, the pile of bank notes upon the table mounted
higher and higher, and the rows of glistening sovereigns grew longer
and longer, until they stretched across the table like streams of yellow
ore. It was difficult to realise how those bleak western plains had ever
produced so much money, and the conviction seemed to force itself upon
the mind that a considerable part of it had either been earned by work
across the Channel, or in remittances from friends and relations on the
other side of the broad Atlantic.</p>

<p>“Father,” exclaimed one of the younger men, pushing excitedly his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
aged parent into the room where the rents were being paid over, “come
along; you have lived to strike a blow for freedom and Ireland.” The
words were uttered with earnestness and enthusiasm. There are upwards
of 300 tenants upon this estate alone who have adopted the
“Plan,” and a further sitting will be necessary in order to receive the
remaining lodgments.</p>

<p>A couple of policemen, who looked chilled and spiritless, walked
about the platform, but made no attempt to interfere with the proceedings.</p>

</div>

<p>It would be useless to add the least comment to
such a picture. When similar scenes are witnessed
everywhere over a country, and accepted by every one
as the natural consummation of events, and the law
is impotent to prevent them, the Revolution is not
impending—it is practically accomplished in the
mind of all classes.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br>
<span class="smaller">SCOTTISH IRELAND.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Enniskillen.</span></p>

<p>If you did not know beforehand that you are
entering a new Ireland through Enniskillen, an Ireland,
Scotch, Protestant, manufacturing, a glance
through the carriage-window would suffice to reveal
the fact. Over the hill, on the right, a fine country-house
waves to the wind, as a defiance to the League, his
orange-coloured flag, the colours of the “<i>Unionists</i>.”
The landlords of Leinster, Munster, and Connaught,
who are Orangemen, as well as others, dare not proclaim
their opinions so boldly, hoist them at the top of the
main mast, so to say; for it might simply cost them
their lives. You must come to “loyal Ulster” to see
such acts of daring, for the simple reason that they
are without danger here.</p>

<p>Another symptom, more eloquent still than the
colour of the flag, is the aspect of the landscape; no
more uncultivated fields, no more endless bogs and
fens. Instead of those long, red, or black streaks of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
peat, alternating with consumptive oat and potato-fields,
green, fat meadows, mown by steam, studded with
cows, in the most prosperous condition, spread themselves
before your eyes. Some trees are to be seen
now. The hedges are in good repair, the horses well
harnessed to solid carts; the hay-stacks have a symmetrical
outline, and vast fields of flax nod under the
breeze; the farm-houses are well built, flanked by
neat kitchen-gardens; in short, all gives the general
impression of a properly cultivated land. Nothing
like the agricultural opulence of Kent or Warwickshire
though, but the normal state of a tolerably good
land, where human industry is not fighting against an
accumulation of almost insuperable obstacles.</p>

<p>Is it that the law is different in Ulster? Not so,
but the custom is. From immemorial times the
tenant-right has been admitted here; and in consequence
the farmer has never hesitated to introduce the
necessary improvements, and to invest his hoard in
the land, sure as he is to profit by it.</p>

<p>That tenant is three times out of five of Scotch
origin; three times out of five he belongs to the Protestant
persuasion (Episcopal, Presbyterian, Methodist);
there is not between him and his landlord the
antagonism of race and worship which is to be found in
other provinces. The landlord himself fulfils his duty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
better, and does not affect to spend abroad the money
he draws from his estate; often that landlord is some
guild or municipal corporation of London or elsewhere,
which perhaps does not make the best use
possible of its income, but is nevertheless obliged to
justify more or less its privilege by some philanthropic
foundation, trials of culture on the large scale, innovation,
and examples.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Lastly, Ulster is a neighbour to Scotland, and
belongs to the same geological, ethnological, commercial,
and religious system. Capital is less timorous
here. It ventures to come, to stay, to circulate. By
the side of agriculture there are important factories,
which help to sustain and feed it. Instead of keeping
invariably to oats, turnips, and the time-honoured
potato, the farmers grow flax on a large scale for the
400,000 spindles which are spinning at Belfast,
Dundalk, and Drogheda.</p>

<p>A certain tendency to aggregate small holdings,
and to constitute in that way great and middling farms,
has been developing lately in Ulster. The peasants
are better lodged and fed than elsewhere in Ireland.
They find day-work more easily because agriculture is
conducted there on more scientific principles, and they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
are not condemned to remain idle four days out of
seven. In short, the economic condition of Scotch
Ireland, without being such as to be offered as a
pattern to the civilised world, is about as good as
possible under the feudal <i>régime</i> and landlordism.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Londonderry.</span></p>

<p>The signs of that relative prosperity are obvious.
Thus in the neighbourhood of Derry (we say Londonderry,
but the natives all say Derry), you observe
with pleasure a line of tramcars moved by steam
machinery, which puts remote places in communication
with the railway. The carriages are of superior
make, divided into three classes, towed by an
engine heated with petroleum. Coming, as you do,
out of Mayo and Galway, that steam tramway puffs
in your face a breath of civilisation. You seem to
enter a different world.</p>

<p>Derry, with its active traffic, its elegant iron bridge
over the Foyle, the fine, new buildings which attest
its wealth, justifies that impression. It is the capital
of the famous “Ulster plantation” of James I., entrusted
by him to the “Honourable Irish Company,”
which included twelve guilds of the city of London.
For a century or two those grants of land did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
answer as had been expected. But they have
ended, in the course of time, by being prosperous.
The municipal estates of Coleraine and Derry are
accounted now the most flourishing in the island.</p>

<p>Yet it does not follow that the tenant’s situation is
very brilliant, even in Ulster. One of the counties
of the province, Donegal, is the poorest in all Ireland,
and two or three others are not much better. Even
in the richest parts the tenant bears chafingly the
yoke of landlordism. The Antrim Tenant Association
went so far this year as to ask for a 50 per cent.
reduction on rent, owing to the low price of produce
and the sheer impossibility of going on paying at the
previous rate. It must be noted that tenant-right
being rigorously observed in Ulster, the farmer always
pays when he is able; for any remissness in paying
would diminish by as much the value of his share in
the proprietorship, which is estimated on an average
at 8 or 10 times the annual farm rent.</p>

<p>The newspapers of the county, even when unfavourable
to agrarian revendications, unanimously
acknowledge that by reason of the constant going
down of prices, resulting from American competition,
the present condition of the agriculturist is about
as bad as it was in the worst famine times. All
the farmers without exception, be they of Scotch or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
Irish race, aver that they actually pay from their own
pockets every penny they give the landlords; that is
to say, they borrow it in the shape of a loan on the
value of their tenant-right.</p>

<p>Such a state of things cannot continue. It explains
how it is that Presbyterian peasants, the most ardent
enemies of Papistry—in theory—none the less give
the majority, even in Ulster itself, to the representatives
of Home Rule and the liquidation of landed
property.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Portrush and the Giant’s Causeway.</span></p>

<p>Portrush is a delicious sea-side place, at the mouth
of Lough Foyle, on the most wonderful coast in
Europe; it is seated on the edge of the Antrim
table-land, which is of volcanic origin: probably a
dependency of Scotland geologically, rather than
belonging properly to Ireland, to which it came and
welded itself, at some unknown epoch. The traveller
has there the agreeable surprise of a delightful hotel—one
should say a perfect one—a regular miracle of
comfort; and the still greater surprise of seeing
there the only electric railway actually working on
this planet. That bijou-line is used to take the
visitors to the wonder of Ireland, the Giant’s Causeway.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
It ascends on the sea-side an acclivity of
about three to four hundred yards, and runs over a
length of five miles up to Bushmills, where the
generators of electricity are set to work by hydraulic
power. Nothing is so fresh or unexpected as that drive
in open carriages. The train ascends lustily along the
electric guiding-rail in the midst of a well-nourished
fire of sparkles called to life by its iron hoofs. As it
rises higher the prospect gets wider and wider, and
you get a view of the Scotch mountains only fifteen
miles distant, while the most extraordinary basaltic
formations are following one another under your eye
along the coast.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Antrim table-land, so geologists tell us,
was formed by a layer of lava three or four hundred
yards high, spread over the chalky bottom of the sea.
Of the volcanoes which vomited that lava no vestige
is to be seen to-day. The glaciers, tumbling down
from the neighbouring heights, have cleared them away.
In times remote, that table-land extended across to
Scotland, to which it united Ireland as by a sort
of prodigious bridge of lava. But the unremitting,
incessant, work of the waters has eaten away by
degrees the cretaceous masses which supported it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
The arches of the bridge were then dislocated and
precipitated into the ocean. Only some traces of it
on both sides are left standing now: the Giant’s
Causeway in Ireland, the point of Cantire in Scotland,
and between the two, the little Island of Rathlin.</p>

<p>Along the coast of Antrim the waves continuing
their destructive work, go on gnawing the foundations
of the cliffs, which they dig and carve like lacework.
Numberless grottoes, rocky needles shaped into the
likeness of steeples, deep chasms at the bottom of
which the foaming waters are for ever contending, are
the result of that perennial work.</p>

<p>Occasionally, as at Dunluce, to the fantastic work of
nature, some ruin that was once an illustrious stronghold,
whose walls, literally hanging over the abyss,
seem to be attached to the firm ground only by a
curved arch of half-a-yard’s breadth, adds an element
of tragic poetry. Under the rock which bear those
dilapidated walls, the sea has dug for itself caves
which are resounding night and day with the deafening
noise of the beating waves. It is grand and
terrible in summer; one can imagine what it must be
when the tempest of a winter night unloosens its fury
within those caverns.</p>

<p>Naturally they are, more than any other place in the
world, rich in legendary lore. The M’Quillans, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
whom belonged Dunluce Castle, boast an antiquity
which outshines greatly that of the descendants of
the Crusaders. These are not people to be content,
like Montesquieu, with two or three hundred years
of acknowledged nobility. They came from Babylon,
it appears, at an epoch exceptionally prehistoric,
and can trace their origin back to 4,000 years ago.
The only branch in existence now dwells in Scotland,
and bear the title of lords of Antrim and
Dunluce.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At Bushmills the electric train stops. There you
alight and take your seat in the car which brings
you to the Causeway Hotel. Here, as the air is
decidedly bracing, and the majority of the tourists
English, luncheon is ready, as you may imagine.
The classic salmon despatched in company with a
glass of ale or porter, the only thing to do is to look
to business and visit the marvels of the place. A
wall, which the provident administration of the hotel
have raised for purposes of safety, hides them as yet
from your sight. When you have passed that
obstacle you find yourself within a sort of circus,
delineated by the cliffs, and at the extremity of
which descends a path that looks anything but safe.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
Total absence of causeway. Where must we look for
it? This a swarm of guides, cicerones, boatmen,
beggars of all descriptions, offer to show you. They
all speak at the same time, fight, wrangle, make you
deaf with their jabbering. Wise is he who sends
them to the devil, and follows peacefully the pathway
which goes to the extremity of the circuit, turns alone
round the foot of the cliff on the right, and penetrates,
unaccompanied, into the neighbouring bay. He will
have the joy of a powerful, wholly personal sensation,
unalloyed by any impure element. But alas! how is
one to guess that? You think you are doing the
right thing in giving the lead to a professional guide.
You choose among the howling crew the less ruffianly
face, and you deliver yourself into the hands of a
cicerone. Fatal error! Henceforward you cease to
belong to yourself. You are no longer a being
endowed with reason and volition, with the free
exercise of your rights; you are an article of luggage
in the hands of a porter, a disarmed traveller in the
power of a Calabrian desperado.</p>

<p>Instead of taking you to the bay on the right, the
arbiter of your destiny begins by laying down as a
dogma that the only means of seeing the causeway
properly is to approach it by sea. On the same occasion
you shall visit the marine caves. Allured by that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
programme, you follow the man, and you embark
with him in a boat rowed by two oarsmen, who greet
your advent rapturously.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Five minutes later you find yourself in total darkness
under the oozing vault of a cavern, where the
fluctuations of the mountainous waves now let the
boat sink suddenly five or six yards down, now heave
it up against the roof, and threaten to shiver your
skull to pieces. In the midst of that frantic jogging
and tossing the guide lights up a Bengal flame, in
order to display to better advantage the variegated
tints of the damp walls, or, it may be, to create the
said tints, if they do not exist. Then he lets off a
pistol in your ear to awake the echoes of the cavern,
which answer to the call with deafening unanimity.</p>

<p>This is the “psychological moment.” The rowers,
laying down their oars, take off their caps and hold
them to you, explaining at the same time that gunpowder
is expensive. You hasten to accede to the
request, and soon after you find yourself, not without
pleasure, in the daylight again.</p>

<p>Not for long, however; for you are expected to do
another cavern. You submit meekly to the programme.
Again that homicidal tossing; another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
Bengal flame; a second pistol shot. This time the
boatmen offer you a box of geological specimens. As
it is, you happen to abhor geology; but how is one
to resist people who have him in their power in a
marine cave?</p>

<p>Liberation comes in time. You breathe again.
The miscreants have the face to mention a third
cavern! But this time you rebel. “No more caverns!
The causeway instantly!”</p>

<p>You double a little promontory, and after two or
three oar-strokes you land on what seems to you at
first a quay with a pavement made with hexagon
slabs.</p>

<p>“Here you are, sir! This is the Giant’s Causeway.”
Let us confess it candidly: the first impression is
disappointment. Is it then that famous Causeway,
that unrivalled wonder? You are ready to believe in
a mystification. But this is only a passing impression
for which the guides, not the Causeway, are responsible.</p>

<p>The truth is, you must not approach it by sea if you
wish to see it well. It is by land only that it can be
understood, like a symphony which would lose half
its charm if executed in the open air. The treason
of the guides is so cruel that it really cries for
vengeance and must be denounced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p>At last you have managed to get rid of them, and
leaving the Causeway, you have climbed up the steep
neighbouring cliffs. And now looking round, you are
struck with stupefaction and rapture at the spectacle
which offers itself to your eyes. That sort of quay
or footpath you deemed at first mean or insignificant
is in reality, when viewed properly, the most
stupendous whim of nature. Imagine a formidable
array of forty thousand columns of prismatic shape
(some one gifted with patience has numbered them),
rising tall and majestic, and pressed against each
other so as to form a continuous, almost level pavement,
which emerges from the sea like a quay of
marble. The symmetry of that pavement is so remarkable,
all those shafts of columns are so well
clamped together, that it seems almost impossible to
admit that this is not human work. You fancy you
are walking on the hexagonal slabs of some Babylonian
palace, whose walls the storm has destroyed.
These paving-stones are neat and even, about
one foot wide, and perfectly regular. Towards the
middle of the quay they rise in a sort of swelling,
which permits one to study their anatomy
and to perceive that they are really formed by
the section of as many upright parallel prismatic
columns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p>There are three Causeways,—the Great, the Little,
and the Middle Causeway. They occupy the centre
of a semi-circular bay, formed by lofty cliffs, which
let you see under a thin covering of clay and grass
other rows of basaltic columns that show their profile,
and have been called “the Organ.” On the
right the bay is limited by a jutting rock, above
which tower two or three needles—“the Chimneypots.”
A local tradition relates that the Invincible
Armada, driven against the cliffs by a strong gale,
mistook the needles for the towers of Dunluce, and
stormed them uselessly a whole day long.</p>

<p>Beyond those basaltic piers a spring of sweet water
forms the “Giant’s Well;” further on a rock, roughly
shaped as a church desk, is called “the Pulpit.” All
those sports of nature compose a whole truly unique
and wonderful. Neither the Alps, nor the chain of
the Andes, nor Mount Vesuvius, nor Etna, can
give you such an impression of grandeur—are able to
that degree to put you as it were into communion
with the mysteries of labouring Nature.</p>

<p>What strikes you further about those basaltic
formations is that they are both colossal, like all
works directly resulting from the great cosmic forces,
and at the same time almost Greek by the quality
and symmetry of their arrangements. For once the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
volcanos seem to have had the whim to work according
to the canons of art. It is both human and
super-human—verily a Giant’s Causeway!</p>

<p>The Giant Fin M’Coul, so the legend says, was
the guardian genius of Ireland. He had for a rival
a certain Scotch Giant of mighty conceit and insolence,
whose boast it was that none could beat him.
The sea alone, if that Scotch braggart was to be
believed, prevented his coming to let M’Coul feel
the might of his arm, as he was afraid of getting a
cold if he attempted to swim across the Straits. So
he remained at home. M’Coul was riled at last by
that swaggering. “Since thou art afraid to get wet,”
he cried to his rival, “I am going to throw a causeway
between Scotland and Ireland, and we shall see
then whether thou darest use it!” The building of
the bridge took only a few thousand years, and then
the Scot, having no pretence left, accepted the challenge,
was beaten flat, and obliged to eat humble pie.
After which, with true Irish generosity, the good-natured
giant gave him his daughter in marriage, and
allowed him to come and settle near him, which the
Scot accepted, nothing loth, Erin being an infinitely
sweeter and generally superior country to his own.
But perhaps, after all, M’Coul found no cause to
rejoice over the match he had arranged for his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
daughter, as he subsequently allowed the sea to
destroy his work so as to prevent any more Scots
from settling in his dominions. Only some of its
piles remain standing, one of which is the Isle of
Rathlin, half-way across the Straits.</p>

<p>The legend, as you see, is not so foolish. It answers
at all points to geological data, and even to historic
truth, viz., the invasion of Ulster by the Scots. But,
let its origin be what it may, the fact remains that
the Giant’s Causeway, with its neighbour, Portnoffen
Bay, the most perfect amphitheatre in the world,
with the marvellous colonnade of the Pleaskin, Dunluce
Castle, Dunseverick, and the bridge of rope of
Carrick-a-Rede, thrown over a chasm that measures
a hundred feet above the waters,—constitute one
of the grandest, most moving spectacles that the
traveller may see. You can go round the world without
having such extraordinary sights. Add to it
that few of the gems of nature are of so easy an
access. From Paris you can be on the coast of Antrim
in twenty hours, by London, Liverpool, and Belfast.
Portrush, with its admirable sea-shore, its electric
railway, and stupendous cliffs, is the ideal frame for a
honeymoon excursion. I had resolved to recommend
it to tourists, and to point out the guides of the Causeway
to public execration. Now I have done my duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Belfast.</span></p>

<p>The capital of Ulster is naturally the most flourishing
town of Ireland. Whereas the others decrease in
population and wealth, Belfast is rapidly thriving.
From 20,000 inhabitants, which it numbered at the
beginning of the century, it has risen in eighty years
to 210,000. Another ten years and it will outdo
Dublin itself. It is a manufacturing city as well as a
big trading port. By an exception, unique in the
island, it occupies a great number of workers, male
and female—60,000, at the lowest computation—for
the most part, in the weaving trade and naval construction.
A single linen factory, that of Messrs.
Mulholland, gives work to 29,000 pairs of hands. It
is those weaving looms which utilize the product of
the 110,000 acres of flax fields in Ulster. Out of
nineteen ships of over 300 tons annually built in the
docks of the island eighteen come out of the Belfast
wharves. It is, in short, the maritime gate of Irish
import and export—the insular suburb of Liverpool
and Glasgow.</p>

<p>As a consequence, signs of prosperity are showing
themselves everywhere. The public walks are vast
and carefully kept, the houses well built, the shops
substantial and elegant, the educational establishments
important and richly endowed. The town has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
a thoroughly Anglo-Saxon aspect. London fashions
are scrupulously followed there. If you enter the
Botanical Garden, maintained by voluntary contributions,
you find there the lawn-tennis, the dresses, the
ways of the metropolis. If you follow the road up to
Cave Hill, one of the heights on the western side of
Belfast, you embrace a vast landscape, where the
flying steamers on the Lagan, the smoking factory-chimneys,
the innumerable and opulent villas round
its shores, all speak of wealth and prosperity.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The population is about equally divided between
Protestants and Catholics. The consequence is that
party hatred and the struggle for local influence are
far more ardent and long-lived here than in places
where one of the two elements has an overwhelming
majority. Electoral scuffles easily turn to bloody
battles; political anniversaries—that of the Battle of
the Boyne, above all—are a pretext for manifestations
which often degenerate into regular battles.</p>

<p>Belfast is the bulwark of Orangeism; and Orangeism
may be described as Protestant and loyalist fanaticism,
as opposed to Catholic and national fanaticism.
Shankhill Road, which is frequently used as a battle-field
by the antagonistic parties, is a long suburb<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
which divides as a frontier line the Orangeist from
the Irish quarters.</p>

<p>Hardly one pay-day passes without the public-houses
of that suburb being the theatre of some pugilistic
feat accomplished by some voluntary representatives
of the opposite camps. If the police
happen to rush into the fray, reinforcements are
called from either side; stones, cudgels, revolvers
come to the rescue, and, on the morrow, the jails are
filled with prisoners, and the hospitals with the dead
and the wounded.</p>

<p>Sad to relate, it is the clergy on both sides who
incite them to those fratricidal struggles. There are
certain Protestant preachers who are in no way behindhand
in bitterness and virulent abuse with the
most fanatic priest of Roscommon or Mayo. I have
heard personally in Falls Road a Methodist preaching
in the open air incite his audience to the extermination
of Papists in strains which the creatures of
Cromwell would not have disowned.</p>

<p>In order that nothing should be missing to the
parallel, Ulster has its Orangeist League, not unlike
the National League of Ireland (save for the respect
of legality and the general moderation of proceedings).
That League is formed into battalions and
companies which are privately drilled, they say, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
lose no occasion to make a pageant in the streets
with accompaniment of trumpets and drums, and
whose ways remind one of the Salvation Army.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On the whole, Ulster is the only province of Ireland
where the Unionist forces are about equally matched
with the party of Home Rule; that is to say, the
former command a majority in Antrim, part of Down,
part of Armagh, part of Derry and Donegal, whilst
the Home Rulers have the stronger array of voters
in the remaining parts of the province. Except in
the above-delineated band of north-eastern territory,
the result of the elections is always taken for granted
beforehand all over the island, and is for—Home
Rule. But this is not saying that the contest is at
all passionate even in Belfast. I happened to be there
on the occasion of the General Election of 1886, and
was most struck by the comparative calm of the
population pending the momentous ballot. I could
not help expressing my surprise, over the mahogany,
to my host, a wealthy mill-owner, a zealous Presbyterian,
and an active Orangeist into the bargain, to
whom an English friend had given me a letter of
introduction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p>“You wonder at our calm?” he said. “The explanation
is very simple. In Ireland the respective
position of parties can hardly be much altered by the
incidents of the struggle. Whether the Home Rulers
take one seat from us or we gain one on them, we
shall neither of us be much benefited by it. It is in
Great Britain that the true battle is taking place.
Let us suppose that Mr. Gladstone, instead of finding
himself in a minority in the next Parliament, returns
to the House with a majority. This majority can in
no case be very strong, and we may still doubt that
it will consent to follow him to the end in the path
he has chosen. But let us go farther, and suppose
Home Rule to have been voted by this majority,—let
us suppose it to have been voted by the Upper
House,—a still more unlikely contingency. Well, our
decision is taken irrevocably. We are perfectly resolved
not to bow to such a vote, and not to submit
to Home Rule.”</p>

<p>“What! shall you rebel against the constitution?”</p>

<p>“Against the constitution, no. But if needs must
be against Mr. Gladstone and his party. We shall
appeal from the ignorant electors to the better informed
ones. We shall protest against a decision
that would in a way deprive us of our rights as British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
subjects. And in the meanwhile we shall refuse to
acknowledge a Dublin Parliament. We shall refuse
to pay the taxes that it may fix upon, or to obey the
laws it may vote. We shall repeat loudly that we are
Englishmen, and will not be anything else; that we
depend on the British Parliament and recognize no
other authority; and we shall see then if our appeal
raise no echo in the United Kingdom!”</p>

<p>“But still, the right of making laws generally
entails the power of enforcing them. What shall
you do on the day when the Dublin Parliament,
having voted the taxes for you as for the rest
of Ireland, shall send tax-gatherers to collect
them?”</p>

<p>“<i>We shall receive them with rifle-shots.</i>”</p>

<p>“What! are you going to tell me that you, sir,
‘worth’ half a million sterling, if the public voice
speaks the truth, that this fat gentleman there, the
father of those two pretty daughters, that this respectable
doctor in gold spectacles, and all your other
guests to-night, all peace-loving, middle-aged gentlemen,
comfortable and with good rent-rolls, seriously
entertain the idea of buckling on your shooting-gaiters
and going to battle in the street?”</p>

<p>“We shall go, if we are obliged, rather than submit
to the Dublin people!... After all, have we not a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
right to remain English, if it suits us?... The very
principle of Home Rule, if it is adopted, implies that
we shall govern ourselves as it seems good to us.
Well, here in Ulster, we are nearly two million loyalist
Protestants, who cherish the pretension of not being
given over to the three million Papists entrusted with
the making of the Dublin Parliament,—who shall dare
to deny this right to us?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Parnell and his friends will certainly deny it
as soon as their programme is embodied into law.
They will say to you, ‘Henceforth Ireland shall
govern herself. Let those who do not like it go
away.’”</p>

<p>“But it is precisely what we shall never do!... Our
title to the Irish soil is as good as the Parnellites’....
Let them try to dislodge us, and they shall have a warm
welcome, I promise you.”</p>

<p>In the course of conversation my worthy interlocutor
had let the number of 100,000 Orangemen, armed to the
teeth and ready to defend Ulster against the Home
Rulers, escape him. I took advantage of this to ask
him for a few details on this organization. I learnt
this: that the Orangeist army is by no means a fallacy,
as one might imagine, and that it forms a sort of
latent militia, with its active forces, and its reserve.
At first, established as a kind of freemasonry, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
formed in “circles” or “lodges,” it comprises actually
four divisions, subdivided into twenty-two brigades:
each of these brigades consists of two or three
regiments, infantry, cavalry, and artillery; in each
regiment are sections and companies, each composed
of affiliates belonging to the same district. Three
divisions are recruited in Ulster proper; the fourth in
Dublin and Cork, in Wicklow and in King’s County.
All those affiliates take the engagement to observe
passive obedience and to render personal service on
the first requisition of their supreme council; they
furnish their own arms and recognise the authority of
a commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>Does all this have any substantial existence besides
what it has on paper? Do the Orangemen secretly
drill, as it is averred, both for the infantry and the
cavalry manœuvres? Is it true that most of the volunteer
companies in Ulster are exclusively Orange
companies? Lastly, are those volunteers really ready
in case of an open rupture with Dublin, to take up
their arms and fight for their cause?... Many
people think it doubtful. The Home Rulers especially
think it pure moonshine and humbug. I
remember one of their papers publishing the following
advertisement last year to show in what esteem they
held the Ulster army:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rotten Eggs! Rotten Eggs! Rotten Eggs!</span></p>

<p><i>Wanted: 100,000 rotten eggs, to be delivered in Tipperary,
worthily to welcome 20,000 Orangemen, armed
with rifles and guns, under command of the illustrious
Johnson. Offers to be addressed to the printing office
of this paper.</i></p>

</div>

<p>This certainly does not indicate a very exalted idea
of the valour of the Orangeist forces on the part of the
southern populations. But that does not mean that
no other sugar plums shall be exchanged. In all civil
wars such pleasantries take place, yet they do not
prevent rivers of blood being shed. One fact alone is
beyond doubt, that the Orange organization has
immense ramifications among the regular troops, and
is openly favoured by General Wolseley; that a
large number of retired officers have entered it;
that one would perhaps find it difficult to find one
among the Queen’s regiments ready to fire on the
loyalists, and that the most ardent partisans of Home
Rule hesitate to grant to the Irish Parliament the
faculty of raising an armed force.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the last word in Ulster may very well
be said by the Orangemen.</p>

</div>

<p>It would have been pleasant to conclude these
pages without recording too harsh a judgment
against England, one of the two or three nations for
ever dear to the thinker; one of those who possess a
brain of her own, not merely a chain of nervous
nodosities presiding over the organic functions; one of
those who lead the Human Race along the hard road
where it toilingly drags its miseries and delusions. It
would have been pleasant at least to find some kind
of extenuating circumstances for the attitude she
maintains doggedly towards Ireland. But this is
sheer impossibility.</p>

<p>All that can be pleaded on behalf of England is
that she is truly unconscious of the wrong she has
been doing for centuries, and that she firmly
believes herself to have acted within her rights.
Nations, still more than individuals, are the slaves of
their temperament, of their faults and their qualities.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
Shall we call the tiger a murderer, or reproach
vultures because they feed on human flesh? They
obey their instincts, and merely follow the dictates of
nature. So it is with nations. Considered no longer
in the individuals that compose it, or in the intellectual
<i>élite</i> that speaks in its name, but in the fifteen or
twenty generations that have woven the woof of its
annals, a people is an irresponsible and blind organism,
fatefully obeying its impulses, be they noble or
base.</p>

<p>Try to talk with a Protestant landlord about the
wrongs and grievances of Ireland. He will tell you
in all good faith that the Irish alone are to blame.
Ignorant, slothful, given to drink, sly and cunning, a
nation of liars,—weak, in a word, and vanquished
beforehand,—this is the verdict he pronounces on
them from the height of his respectable rent-roll. If
they have failed in the struggle for life, it is because
they came into it badly armed and unprepared. So
much the worse for them,—let them make way for the
stronger ones! Such is the theory.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that it is put forward in all
sincerity by a majority of Englishmen. But this does
not prove that it rests on any sound foundation. It
only proves once more that they are incapable of
understanding anything about the Irish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
temperament.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> This reasoning is merely the classic sophistry.
They mistake the effect for the cause, and are blind
to the fact that those vices they so bitterly reproach
the Irish with, are the inevitable result of three
centuries of bad administration and England’s own
work. Wherever it has been liberated from the
English yoke, has not, on the contrary, the Irish race
displayed abundant energy, activity, genius? Do not
the Irish hold the first rank in the United States, in
Canada, in Southern America, in Australia, wherever
emigration has carried them. In England even are
they not at the head of all liberal professions,
letters, the daily press, the bar, science? Those who
have seen and closely studied that nation, crushed
under its secular burden, ground under the heel of the
conqueror, cannot but feel surprised at the bare fact
that it survives; and this fact alone presupposes the
most admirable gifts. One could even question
whether, deprived of the Irish Celt element, for leaven,
for chiefs, for counsellors, in letters, and in assemblies,
the heavy Anglo-Saxon race could ever have founded
its flourishing colonies. These prosper, one may say,
in direct proportion to the number of Irish that
come to them, even as the mother island slowly decays<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
in direct proportion to the number of her children
that are driven from her shores.</p>

<p>Why should such slanderous explanations be sought
for a fact sufficiently explained by history? The great
misfortune of Ireland is not to be a nation less richly
gifted than its conqueror, but only to be too small
a nation, established in an open island. The Irish have
been neither more vicious, nor more fanatical, nor
more slothful than the English; they have been less
numerous, less well armed; and John Bull, according
to his deplorable custom, has taken advantage of their
weakness for bullying them, for levying heavy toll on
them, for bleeding them to death without mercy. He
has taken their land, their freedom, their industry,
and still wrests from them the product of their labour.
And, to crown all, he dares to call them to account
for their misery as for a crime—this misery, which is
his own work, with all its wretched following of vices
and degradation.</p>

<p>Before such a sight as this involuntary indignation
must be felt. One wishes to say to the English—</p>

<p>“You pirates, begin first by giving back to Ireland
all you have taken from her, and you shall see then
if she be guilty of this poverty you consider as a
crime! Let us reckon. Give her back her land,
which your nobles occupy. Give her back the bravest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
of her sons, that you have driven to emigration. Give
her back the habit of work which you have destroyed
in her. Give her back the wealth which you prevented
her accumulating, by forbidding her commerce and
industry. Give her back the millions which you still
exact every year upon the produce of her agricultural
energy. Give her back the experience of freedom
that you have so long crushed in her. Give her back
the faculty of coolly reasoning about her beliefs, which
persecution took from her. Give her back the right of
self-government according to her genius, her manners,
her will, that right which you declare sacred and
imprescriptible for every nation, that you grant to
your most insignificant colonies, to the meanest
island of your Empire, and which you refuse to her,
the biggest of all. Give her back all this, and let us
see then if Ireland be all you say.”</p>

<p>“Alas! from that national inheritance of which
you robbed her one can only find now, recognise
and therefore give back, the land and the money.
The land stands always there; and money is not
wanting in your coffers. A good impulse, then! All
has to be paid for in this world—defeat and failure
like anything else. If one lose a game, one must
know how to pay for it gallantly. If one has, personally,
or in the person of one’s father, committed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
an unjust act, one must know how to atone for it.
Your railway companies give indemnities to the
families of those they have crushed to death. Yourselves,
as a nation, have paid in the Alabama affair,
once convinced of being in the wrong. Here also, in
Ireland, the hour of Justice has come. Evidence is
over. Your work rises in your throat and sickens
you. You cannot any longer doubt, and your writers
daily repeat it, that the cause of all Ireland’s
sufferings is in your spoliation, complicated by your
administration. Well, the remedy is clear. Ireland
herself points it out to you, and your conscience
whispers it: you must give back her inheritance to
Ireland, with the right of administering it according
to her own lights.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>England is fond of comparing herself to Rome,
though it is Carthage rather that she resembles. She
can find in Roman history a precedent for the solution
that is obviously suited to Ireland. The <i>Lex
Licinia</i>, promulgated in the year 376 before the
Christian era, limited to 500 arpents, that is to say,
almost exactly 500 acres, the extent of land that the
patricians were entitled to possess in a conquered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
country. This was the law that the Gracchi wanted
to bring to life again, and for which they paid the
penalty of death. It has long been believed, and
Mably repeated it with Montesquieu, that the question
was the dividing of private property between all the
citizens. Niebuhr and Savigny have re-established
historical truth, and shown that the question at issue
was merely the limitation of, or atonement for, usurpations
that ruined the State by ruining the rural populations.
It is a Licinian Law that is wanted in Ireland,
and it is to be hoped that England will give it to her
before long.</p>

<p>The disease of Ireland may be defined: the feudal
system or landlordism, complicated by absenteeism
and usury, having for its consequences extreme
penury of capital, rural pauperism, and the incapacity
for struggling against American competition.</p>

<p>The case of Ireland, more acute by reason of its
special sphere, is only a striking instance of a fact
that the legislators of the old world must necessarily
take into account henceforth, the fact that the
immense area of land newly cleared in the two
Americas, in Australia, and India, are, four-fifths of
them at least, the property of those that cultivate
them personally. They have no other burden to bear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
than taxes, and are therefore in a condition of crushing
superiority in the struggle with the countries in
which dual ownership obtains. With an equal fruitfulness
(and that of virgin soil is almost always
greater), it is clear that the soil which supports only
those that cultivate it, instead of two or three superposed
classes of participants in its products, must
always be able to give those products at a lesser cost
price, and therefore will be able to throw them on the
market at a lower rate. It is not merely common
sense, it is the immutable course of human progress
that condemns landlordism to disappear ere long from
the face of the globe.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Reduced to its elementary terms, the Irish question
stands thus: 12,000 landowners, of foreign origin,
possessing almost the whole of the island; 1940 of
these proprietors detaining two-thirds of this soil; 744
holding the half of it. All these lands parcelled out
into insufficient holdings, and cultivated by 720,000
native farmers, for the most part entirely devoid of
capital. The agricultural product of the island,
divided between two schedules on the official rolls of
the income tax: the first one of £2,691,788 only,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
representing the income of the 720,000 Irish farmers
and their families; the second, of £13,192,758, representing
the income of the 12,000 English landlords.
The half at least of this sum leaving the island every
year, and being spent outside it by the <i>absentee</i> landlords.
Not one farthing of this lordly income coming
back to the soil, either directly or indirectly, in the
shape of manure, buildings, or agricultural improvements;
nor to industry, which is nil. General
pauperism, resulting from the feudal organization
that stops development of wealth in its germ, and
more and more unfits the country for a struggle with
the more normally organized nations. Unpaid rents,
landlords and tenants eaten up by usurers, a permanent
conflict of interests shown at each term by three
or four thousand evictions, without mentioning the
still more numerous cases in which eviction is not
carried out because it would prove useless. A universal
bankruptcy; a chronic state of social war;
a growing contempt of the law; agrarian violence;
the suspension of public liberties; a gradual return of
the soil and its inhabitants to the savage condition; a
constant augmentation in the area of uncultivated
land; a regular emigration of the adult and able
population; a quarter of the remaining inhabitants
living at the expense of the ratepayers, either on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
outdoor relief or in the workhouses; financial grievances,
added to historical and political grievances;
hunger sharpening the rancour of the vanquished
race; its hatred of the conqueror shown periodically
by the return to the House of Commons of 85 members
whose only mandate is to obstruct the regular
working of the British machinery. Such is the
epitome of the results obtained in Ireland by the
English after an occupation of seven centuries. Never
did history register such a scandalous failure.</p>

<p>Vainly do Oxford and Cambridge, in order to
explain or palliate it, resort to all their scholastic
sophistry. Vainly it is endeavoured to discover its
cause in some inherent vice of the Irish race, in their
ignorance, their religion, their laziness, and even a
sort of “melancholy” imparted to them, it is alleged,
by the neighbourhood of the ocean (<i>sic</i>).</p>

<p>Ireland is not the only country edged by the
Atlantic: neither is it the saddest. Her children are
not in any marked degree more illiterate now-a-days
than those of England, and if they were so for a long
time—when they had to slip off to unlawful and
clandestine “hedge schools” if they wanted to learn
their alphabet—we know too well who was responsible
for such an outrage on civilization. The Celts of
Erin are Roman Catholics, it is true, but after all there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
are on our planet a certain number of nations who
have not died yet of this religion. As for their
political capacity, they vindicate it every day by the
wisdom and firmness they display in sustaining the
struggle against the oppressor.</p>

<p>One must bow to evidence and do justice to Ireland.
And for this there are not two formulas. There is
only one, in two articles:</p>

<p>1.—Expropriation of the landlords with a fair
indemnity, to the profit of the Irish tenantry.</p>

<p>2.—The extension to Ireland of Home Rule, which
is the invariable rule of all British possessions, near
or far, guaranteed of course by all the precautions
judged necessary for the security and unity of the
United Kingdom.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is the glory of Mr. Gladstone to have understood
and to have had the moral courage to declare that
there is no other solution. And as we think of this,
is it not a strong argument in favour of the superior
justice of agrarian revendications in Ireland, that it
should have imposed itself to the reason of that
illustrious politician, the most English assuredly of
all the statesmen that have succeeded each other in
office since the time of William Pitt? Those common<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
reasoners who rebel against a necessary restitution,
should think of this. Here is an old man seventy-eight
years of age, who, ever since he left Eton, had
no other care, no other occupation than the affairs of
his country; the most energetic, the most active and
brilliant of leaders, the most experienced in finance;
of all the orators in the British Parliament the most
lucid and pungent; a refined scholar, an accomplished
Hellenist, the possessor of an hereditary fortune that
frees him from domestic cares, the son of a British
merchant-prince, and the father of an Anglican
clergyman, himself Protestant to the core, and fond
of officiating in the place of his son in the church of
Hawarden; a man whose predominant quality is his
earnestness, and whose supreme rule of conduct is a
well-regulated love of his country. This statesman,
who has been ten times in office since the year, already
so far from us, when he entered it under the leadership
of Robert Peel, and who knows everything about the
affairs of his country at home and abroad, has made
his life-study of the Irish question. Twenty times in
forty years has he attempted to grapple with it, to
unravel it, to solve it. All the remedial measures
that have been applied to the wounds of Ireland since
1860 had him for their initiator. He was the first to
realize the odious wrong of an established Anglican<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
Church in that Catholic country. To him is due the
political and intellectual enfranchisement of the Irish;
it was he who gave them national schools and who
put them (by dint of what Titanic struggles!) on the
same electoral footing as the other British subjects.
It was he who promoted, defended, and succeeded in
passing all the Land Bills meant to soften the wretched
fate of the Irish serf. Lastly, one must not forget it,
he never hesitated, when he thought it necessary, to
claim laws of repression against agrarian violence.
Mr. Gladstone is assuredly no anarchist. He is
neither a madman nor is he in his dotage. Never
was his genius clearer, his word more eloquent. Add
to this that this man, enamoured of power like all
those who have passed their life in it, knew that he
was courting a certain fall when he proposed his solution
of the Irish question, and could entertain no
doubt of the schism that would take place in his
party on the subject....</p>

<p>And yet his conscience could oppose no resistance
to the blinding light of facts. He clearly saw that
palliatives were insufficient, and that there was an
urgent need to take the evil at its root. As a conclusion
to half a century spent in studying the case, and to
twenty local attempts at healing it, after two or three
thousand nights spent in the House of Commons in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
discussing the question under all its aspects, he comes
forward to say: “<i>Justice to Ireland!</i> we must give
back to her what was taken from her—her inheritance
and her freedom!”</p>

<p>Can one suppose for a moment that Mr. Gladstone
came to such a conclusion without the most decisive
and powerful motives? Can anyone feel himself
strong enough to hold opinions better founded than
his on this matter? We must congratulate his
adversaries on their happy self-confidence; but
we cannot do so on their moral sense or on their
modesty.</p>

<h3>I.—<span class="smcap">Mr. Gladstone’s Scheme.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Gladstone’s scheme was framed in two
organic Bills. By the first the British Government
undertook to expropriate the landlords, and to
redeem the Irish lands on a basis of twenty times
the actual rent, to be paid in English Consols, at par.
These lands would then be sold to the Irish tenants
at a discount of 20 per cent., payable in forty-nine
years by instalments equal to about half the former
rent. The second Bill provided for the local government
of Ireland, while it reserved for Great Britain
the general control of the revenue and the right of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
keeping military forces in the island. Thanks to a
coalition of a fraction of the Liberal party with the
Tories, this programme fell to the ground at the
General Election of 1886, and was set aside by
Parliament.</p>

<p>It may be that the loss is not much to be regretted.
Very likely Mr. Gladstone’s scheme was, in his own
thoughts, only meant as a trial, what we call a <i>ballon
d’essai</i>. Excellent in its twofold principle, his solution
had the very serious drawback of substituting, in
the place of the 12,000 present landlords of Ireland—a
single one, the State. It looked as if it
solved all difficulties, and perhaps it would have
caused fresh complications. In fact, it amounted to
requiring that the unavoidable liquidation should be
paid—by which people? By those who could least
afford it—the Irish tenants. Whence might the poor
devils have taken the money for their annuities?
And even admitting that they could have found it,
can one refuse to see that their culture, so wretched
already, would have become still poorer? Has ever
man chosen, to buy an estate, the moment when he is
a confirmed bankrupt?</p>

<p>But it would have been to them a nett gain of one-half
on their actual rent, it will be objected.</p>

<p>A nett gain of one-half <i>on nothing</i>, then, as they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
cannot afford to pay any rent just now, unless they
deduct it from their capital (supposing that they have
any), and there is no reason to suppose that things
will be better for the next fifty years.</p>

<p>Besides, if you admit that by paying for forty-nine
years half the actual rent as judicially fixed, the Irish
tenants ought to have the ownership of the land, why,
in the name of all that is fair, refuse to see that they
have paid it more than ten times already, in the
shape of excessive rent?</p>

<p>“They were free not to pay it and go out, with
their goods and chattels,” says my old friend, the
Economist. I answer: No. They were not, for a
thousand reasons, and had to obey the will of the
vampires, as long as it was strictly possible.</p>

<p>Either the tenants, having become proprietors in
name but not in reality (or, as it were, proprietors of
a shadow of land mortgaged for half a century),
would have paid their annuity,—and in that case
they were as poor as before; or they would not have
paid it, and then the Liberal party would have heard
a fine din!</p>

<p>In fact the Gladstone plan rested on an entirely
chimerical hope: that of settling the Irish question
without its costing a penny to the British Exchequer.
To entertain such a hope is clearly to prove that one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
sees indeed the evil, but without descrying its deeper
cause.</p>

<p>This cause lies in the <span class="smcap">impossibility</span> to the modern
tenants, in the face of the competition of better
organized countries, and generally under the present
conditions of the world’s agriculture, <span class="smcap">to pay any
rent whatever</span>.</p>

<p>The Irish tenant is a bankrupt, because he has
paid, for too long a time already, the rent that he
could not afford. The land is impoverished for the
very same reason. Now, to sell it to a penniless
buyer is absurd enough; but to pretend to believe
that the penniless buyer shall render it prosperous
and make it yield riches, is perhaps more absurd still.</p>

<p>Such illusions ought to be discarded. If England
really wants to settle the Irish question, as her honour
and her true interest both command her to do, she
must manfully accept the idea of a pecuniary sacrifice
and a real restitution. It would be useless to cheat
herself into acceptance of half-measures. She had
much better weigh the real cost of an imperious duty,
pay it, and square matters once for all.</p>

<p>Not only must she give, <i>gratuitously give away</i> as a
present, the land to the Irish tenant, but she must
provide him, at the lowest rate of interest, with the
capital necessary for putting that land in working order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span></p>

<p>This consummation might perhaps be attained
at a lesser cost than would at first sight appear
possible,—let us name a figure,—at a cost of one
milliard francs, or £40,000,000. But this milliard
should be forthcoming in cash, presented by the
British nation to the sister isle as a free gift, a
premium paid for peace, or rather a lump sum of
conscience-money, such as we see sometimes advertised
in the columns of the <i>Times</i>.</p>

<h3>II.—<span class="smcap">An Outsider’s Suggestion.</span></h3>

<p>The ideal solution for the innumerable difficulties
of the Irish question would evidently be the <i>tabula
rasa</i>,—the hypothesis that would transform Ireland
into a newly-discovered island of virgin soil, barren
and uninhabited, where England had just planted her
flag, and out of which she wished to get the fullest
value in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>What would her policy be in such a case? She
would begin by surveying the whole extent of her
new acquisition, by parcelling it out in lots carefully,
then by calling in colonists and capital.</p>

<p>To the immigrants that came without any other
wealth than their stalwart arms, she would make
gratuitous concessions of small lots of land, accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
by seeds, agricultural implements, and an
exemption from taxes during a limited period of time.
To those who came with capital, she would give more
important plots of ground, either demanding a premium
of occupation more or less high, shortening the
period of exemption for taxes, or again elevating the
rate of those taxes. Most likely, too, she would
favour the establishment of an Agricultural Bank that
would advance to the new colonists such moneys as
they desired, according to their wants, their chances
of success, and the individual securities they presented.</p>

<p>In reality it cannot be supposed that in Ireland the
past, the vested interests and the settled habits of
centuries, can be erased. But at least one can try to
come near to this ideal; and besides, this island presents,
over the barren and uncultivated one, the
advantage of having a ready-made population; the
country, its climate, its soil, are known; there is a
large proportion of able workmen, valuable house
property, no inconsiderable provision in agricultural
implements, not to mention several thousand head
of horse, oxen, sheep, and pigs ready imported.</p>

<p>The advantages of this over a virgin island are,
therefore, very clear; they are visibly stronger than
the drawbacks, and success is certain if measures of
the kind we allude to are vigorously carried out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span></p>

<p>England, then, must begin by buying out, not only
the properties of the landlords, but also, and this is
only justice, the interest that a large number of
farmers possess in those lands under the name of
tenant-right. The area of cultivated land in Ireland
(exclusive of towns) is, in round numbers, fifteen million
acres. Before all, the basis of indemnity granted
to the landlords must be fixed.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone proposed the basis of twenty times
the actual rent, as judicially fixed. This seems an
exorbitant price, for various reasons. The first reason
is that no leased land under the sun normally yields
to its owner, at present, anything like the interest
supposed by such a valuation. The second reason is
that the landlords’ property in Ireland has actually
no real value whatever; it could not find a purchaser,
probably, at the price of three times the nominal rent,
were it put up for sale (let anyone who commands
capital, and who looks for a secure investment, consider
whether he would ever dream of buying Irish
land, just now, at any price). The third reason is
that the true responsibility of the Irish disease rests
with those very landlords who never did their duty
by the country. Granted that their faults (one would
rather say crimes) ought to be covered by the benefit
of prescription, and that a fair indemnity ought to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
be given them or their creditors if they are dispossessed
by measures of public sanitation, it would look
ridiculous,—indecent to go to the length of rewarding
them for their moral and economical failure by a disproportionate
indemnity taken out of the pocket of
the British taxpayer.</p>

<p>When one hears, therefore, Mr. Gladstone speak of
giving the landlords twenty times the nominal rent of
their land, one is reduced to admit that his idea was
to bribe them into acquiescence to his scheme by an
exorbitant premium. The Irish landlords did not
understand their true interest; they did not see that
they should have thrown into the scale the weight of
their votes. Very likely they were wrong. They may
say good-bye to the Gladstone indemnity; they will
never see it again. For the longer they wait to settle
this question, the more must farm-rent dwindle away
and indemnity shrink to nothingness.</p>

<p>It seems that, at present, in fixing it on the basis
of twelve times the judicial rent, the British nation
would show great liberality. It would be equivalent
to saying that Irish land, as an investment, is worth
one-third the capital in English Consols that bears
the same interest, which is certainly paying it an
unexpected compliment.</p>

<p>As for the tenant-right of the farmer, which it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
equally indispensable to redeem if all is to be cleared
and there are to be no more conflicts of interests, let
us admit that it is worth, on the whole, three or four
times the judicial rent. Very likely again this is
excessive. But this matters little practically, as will
be shown further on. We find thus, for the aggregate
interest vested in the Irish soil and subject to indemnity,
a common rate of sixteen times the judicial
rent.</p>

<p>The average of this judicial rent is ten shillings per
acre. For fifteen millions of cultivated acres to be
redeemed, this would therefore give a total sum of
120 millions sterling to be paid. Thanks to this indemnity
of expropriation, the English nation would
become absolutely free to dispose of these lands as
she pleased.</p>

<p>But where are those 120 million pounds to be
found? and they must be found over and above the
capital necessary for the working of these lands, since
we admitted in principle that it would be necessary
to find it in most cases. This is the way:</p>

<p>As a first outlay, we have admitted that the British
Exchequer would put down £40,000,000 sterling in
the shape of Consols at par. That capital represents
an interest of about one million sterling and a quarter,
or an annual tax of about ninepence per head. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
certainly would not be a high price to pay for such a
precious advantage as the suppression of the Irish
plague. There is no decade in which a great nation
does not pay more for some unlucky and useless
venture—the Afghanistan campaign, as a case in
point.</p>

<p>To these 40 millions sterling, sacrificed by the
wealthiest of European nations to its internal peace,
shall be added the resources proper to Ireland. These
are no despicable ones. Ireland, taxed much lower
than Great Britain, nevertheless contributes no less
than eight millions sterling, in round numbers, to the
general revenue of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Of these £8,000,000 about £4,286,519 go to the
keeping of the army of occupation and the administration
of finances; in other words, to the services
meant to remain “imperial” in the hypothesis of
Home Rule. About £3,744,462 are paid for the
services that would, in this hypothesis, come into the
province of the Irish Parliament, viz., public works,
law courts, tax-gathering, local administration, registrations,
land-surveying, lunatic asylums, schools,
prisons, and the like. It seems that a new and poor
country, as we suppose Ireland to turn out, ought not
to pay for such services as liberally as does wealthy
England, and that a reduction of a third on these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
heads, or £1,250,000, is perfectly feasible. That is
about the income for £40,000,000 in English Consols.
Here, then, we have sufficient provision for a second
milliard in the shape of <i>interest</i>.</p>

<p>The interest for the third milliard would easily be
raised in the shape of additional taxes, if Irish agriculture
were freed from any other charges. That would
only increase the annual taxation by about a sixth
part, and would not even then put it on a level with
the incidence of English taxation. Ireland, on her
side, might well do this slight sacrifice to the cause
of social and political peace.</p>

<p>There, then, we have the £120,000,000 wanted (in
the shape of a special loan, emitted and guaranteed by
England), which are found—a third by each of the
high contracting parties; a third by a reduction of 33
per cent. on all services that would have become
purely Irish.</p>

<p>How ought this magnificent lump of money to be
used to make it bear all it can? By lodging the
whole in the coffers of a special <i>Bank of Liquidation</i>,
that would be entrusted with all the operation.
This bank, strong in her guaranteed capital of
£120,000,000, invested, if necessary, with the power
of emitting special paper-money, begins by paying all
the lands on the basis fixed upon by law. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
implies only, at the most, an outlay of £90,000,000.
These lands the bank divides into three classes.</p>

<p><i>Class A.</i>—The fee simple of the first class, composed
of the holdings under £10 a year, is simply
transferred to their actual holders (as would be
done in an infant colony in order to attract inhabitants),
subject to the single proviso that these lands
shall be cultivated after a given system, and according
to certain rules, and taken back by the public domain,
if this condition be not observed.</p>

<p>Let us remark, in passing, that this free gift will, in
the majority of cases, be only the legalization of a
<i>de facto</i> gratuitous occupation, most of these small
tenants having, for the last three or four years, stopped
paying any rent to the landlords.</p>

<p>Where, in that case, will be their advantage? it
might be asked. They will be no richer for having
become landowners in point of law, as they are now in
fact.</p>

<p>This is a material error, as shown by the example
of our peasant proprietors in France. One of the
chief reasons that prevent the small Irish tenant
endeavouring to get all he can out of his land is precisely
the rooted wish in his mind not to work
for the benefit of the landlord. From the day that he
shall be certain of keeping the entire fruit of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
labour to himself, he will emulate the French Celt;
he will submit himself to the hardest privations and
the most unremitting toil; he will abundantly manure
his land, ceaselessly tend it, turn it again and again;
he will make it yield all it can. Anyhow, if he does
not, he will have only himself to blame for it.</p>

<p><i>Class B.</i>—The second class of land, composed of
holdings from 15 to 20 acres and over, is sold
to its actual holders for the price of their tenant
right, if they be willing to accept this privilege. In
the contrary case, the tenant right is paid down to
them at the rate fixed upon by experts, and the fee
simple is put up for sale by auction. The ultimate
proprietors of these domains of average extent
receive, by the hands of the local agents for the <i>Bank
of Liquidation</i>, every facility to form themselves into
unions for the collective culture of their land. They
remain, however, free to cultivate it themselves and in
their own fashion.</p>

<p><i>Class C.</i>—The third portion of the soil, formed by
the choicest land, shall be put aside in each district to
form a great domain where experiments shall be tried
and examples given in agriculture—a domain managed
by official agronomists, and cultivated by associations
of agricultural labourers, salaried partly in kind on
the product of the land, partly by participation in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
nett profits. Not only shall there be introduced on
those great domains, together with the finest breeds
of cattle, the most perfect and scientific modes of
culture, but, besides, public demonstrations and
lectures shall be made, agricultural pupils shall be
formed, and seeds of first quality shall be given at cost
price. These model-farms alone remain the property
of the State, and are inalienable.</p>

<p>Thus would be constituted at once, together
with a class of peasant proprietors, the middle
and great cultures which are equally wanting in
Ireland.</p>

<p>Special laws abolish entail in the island, submit to
expropriation (for 25 years at least) any owner non-resident
on his property, and forbid, under pain of
heavy fines, to hold or give on lease any parcel of
land under 12 acres.</p>

<p>Other laws, imitated from the <i>Homestead Exemption</i>
of the United States, protect the peasant against debt.
The <i>Liquidation Bank</i>, after having set the new system
in motion, secures its working by advancing at the
lowest rate of interest the capital wanted by the
small and middling landowners, which must before
long kill usury and drive it from the country. This
bank is, in every sense, the organ and focus of a fiduciary
circulation that is amply sufficient, on this broad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
basis, for all the financial wants of agricultural
industry.</p>

<p>Thus, the whole revenue of the land remaining in
the country, circulating freely, and incessantly undergoing
its normal transformations, health returns by
degrees to the social body. There is no longer any
question of “unemployed” labourers; on the contrary,
it is rather hands that are wanted on all those flourishing
estates which have day-work to offer, not only to
the owners of small holdings, but even to the unemployed
of Great Britain.</p>

<p>And so England begins rapidly, though indirectly,
to recover her advance, owing to the quick increase
in the returns of the Income Tax; in perhaps four or
five years, that increase covers the interest of her
£40,000,000. It comes to say that her real outlay
turns out to be only a tenth or a twelfth part of that
advance. Emigration suddenly receives a check.
Nay, a new, liberated, prosperous Ireland sees her
children flock back to her shores from abroad, enriched
and reconciled, bringing home their capital
with their experience. For the Irishman ever keeps
in his heart unimpaired the love of his mother
country, and will return to her as soon as he can.</p>

<p>Let us carry our hypothesis further.</p>

<p>At the same time when she gave up the responsibilities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
of the local government of Ireland, England
has transmitted them to the representatives of the
Irish nation.</p>

<p>Are those representatives to form immediately a
single Parliament sitting at Dublin, or are they for
the present to be divided into four provincial
assemblies for Leinster, Munster, Connaught, and
Ulster? This question is of small importance, at
least at the beginning. Let the first step be taken;
an united Ireland will only be a matter of time. The
best way in such cases is to follow the expressed wish
of the populations; and supposing that Ulster, or at
least a part of Ulster, vote for the continuation of the
present <i>régime</i>, why should not those territories be
excepted from the new arrangements, and either be
left <i>in statu quo</i> or joined politically to Scotland,
of which they are a geological as well as an ethnical
dependency? But I cannot help thinking that if the
above system was submitted to the Antrim tenants
themselves, they would not be backward to see its
advantages.</p>

<p>On the whole question the last word should remain
to the voter. If a majority of the electors of Scottish
Ireland spoke in favour of Home Rule, what could be
objected to them? That they will eventually be
oppressed by the Catholics? No great fear of that, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
should think; and besides, efficient measures could be
taken, guarantees found against that danger; but no
such caution will be really wanted. The influence of
the Catholic clergy in Ireland has for its principal
basis the political state of the country. The day when
difficulties are cleared up, national education will
soon have put an end to the reign of clericalism in
Ireland as elsewhere.</p>

<p>One cannot help feeling firmly convinced that Mr.
Gladstone’s formula, “Home Rule and Abolition
of Landlordism,” taken in its most general meaning,
and applied with a spirit both prudent and liberal,
will suffice to heal in a few years the disease of
Ireland. Public wealth will rise by degrees, feelings
of hatred will die away, the rapidity of the cure will
take the world by surprise. Has not already the
adoption of the Irish programme by a large number
of Englishmen belonging to the Liberal party been
sufficient to bring about a partial reconciliation between
the two countries? We have seen Irish orators come
and preach the Liberal gospel in England, and reciprocally,
English orators go and bring the word of
peace to Ireland. That alone is an augury of success,
a symptom of healing and pacification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Will it be objected that this is a Utopian picture,
an unpractical scheme, or simply one of difficult execution?
As for me, the more I look into the matter,
the more settled grows my belief that three things
only are requisite for substituting so much good for so
much evil, viz., money, steadiness of purpose and conscience.
Nobody will say that the English have ever
shown a lack of steadiness in the pursuit of success;
money they have in abundance; will they be wanting
in conscience? This is scarcely to be feared. Conscientiousness
of a more or less enlightened kind is a
characteristic of the Englishman, and it is his highest
praise. Men are constantly to be met in England
who rule their conduct on the principles of an inward
law. It is true that, by a natural consequence,
many are good only in name, and their display
of conscience is only a sham; but as our great
moralist has said, “Hypocrisy is a homage which
vice renders to virtue,” and wherever vice is obliged
to wear a mask, virtue is bound to conquer.</p>

<p>A great transformation, the instruments of which
are the press, the steam-engine, and the telegraph,
has been slowly developing throughout the world
during the last few years: a new and powerful influence
has been born that might be named “obligatory
justice through publicity.” Tennyson has spoken of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
“the fierce light that beats upon a throne;” thrones
now-a-days scarcely exist except in name; the will of
the people has taken their place. But let Governments
call themselves republics or monarchies, they
are equally submitted to that pitiless ray of light
which is the ever-wakeful eye of the press, the uncompromising
publicity which ignores either rank or
station. How many examples of it have we not seen
at home! To quote a recent one, take that wretched
Schnæbelé affair. Only fifteen years ago there would
have been found in it reasons ten times sufficient to
bring about a war for those who wanted it. Not so
in our days. In less than twenty-four hours the press
had brought to light the most minute details of the
affair, exposed the naked truth to the eyes of the
world, photographed the place where the incident had
occurred, submitted, in short, to the great public
judge all the evidence of the case. One had to
tender apologies under pain of being called the
aggressor, and the whole affair evaporated into smoke.</p>

<p>Such results are perhaps the clearest gain that
modern progress has given us. If our age has a
superiority over the preceding ages, it is assuredly to
have succeeded in making injustice more difficult to
practise. More and more henceforward will great
national crimes become impossible. Mr. Gladstone’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
chief merit will be to have understood it before
anybody in England, and to have been emphatically
the man of his time. In spite of friends and adversaries
he has dared to utter the truth, and say: “We
must give back to Ireland what we have taken from
her. The good of England imperiously demands
that sacrifice, for we are entering an age when the
honour of a great nation should not even be suspected.”</p>

<p>He is actually the only statesman in Europe who
follows a policy of principle; the only one seeking
the triumph of his opinions by the sole help of reason.
All the others, from the most famous to the most
obscure or passing politician, are only jobbers. Disraeli
had too much of the mountebank about him to
have been able to secure the respect of posterity.
Gortschakoff was only a courtier of the old school;
Cavour a clever lawyer; Thiers a dwarf, in a
moral and political, as in a physical, sense.
Bismarck profits by a state of affairs which he did
little or nothing to create, and at the most is the
belated representative in our times of fossil feudalism.
Gladstone alone is a truly modern statesman, and
therefore is destined to be set by history above all
his contemporaries, if only he succeeds in carrying
out his great enterprise; for the more we go the more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
nations shall be restricted to politics of principle,
both because all other systems are exploded, and
because the diffusion of learning will be for the
future an almost insuperable obstacle to petty or
brutal diplomatic conspiracies.</p>

<p>Great Britain, it is earnestly to be hoped, will consent
to follow her great leader in the way he has
shown to her. She is offered the most splendid
opportunity of doing what no nation has achieved as
yet,—atoning, of her own free will, for centuries of
injustice, and trying one of the noblest social experiments
that can ever be attempted. It would be the
beginning of a new era in the history of human
societies, and pure glory for those who initiated it.
Not only could such results be attained at little cost,
but the most obvious, the most pressing interest of
England invites her to the enterprise. Let her make
haste. After having affirmed for half a century the
sovereignty of peoples, and their right to govern
themselves according to their will, she cannot give
herself the lie at home. After having protested
against Bomba and the Bulgarian atrocities, she
cannot in her own dominions remain beneath “the
unspeakable Turk.” After having assumed before
the world the attitude of a systematic foe to slave-trade
and all kinds of oppression or cruelty, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
having carried it even to maudlin sensitiveness, as
in the case of pigeon-shooting, “birds’ corpses on
women’s hats,” and the like, she cannot decently carry
on the slow destruction of a sister race through
starvation. She cannot and she will not do it, for it
would be branding herself for ever as Queen of
Humbug, Empress of Sham.</p>

<i class="smaller">EXTRACTS FROM SOME LETTERS ADDRESSED
WITHIN THE LAST TWO YEARS TO AN IRISH
LANDLORD BY HIS TENANTS.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The <i>Times</i> has published, on October 10, 1887, an
exceedingly interesting batch of letters selected from
some three hundred addressed within the last two
years to an Irish landowner by his tenants. As the
editor of those letters wrote most appropriately, there
is perhaps no means whereby truer insight can be obtained
into the ways and habits of the Irish peasantry
than by studying the letters written by the people
themselves. Typically enough, however, the same
editor only saw in those letters how “unbusiness-like
and illogical is the Irish tenant,” and “the various
reasons that an Irishman gives for not paying his rent.
One is unable to pay because his uncle is confined to
bed, and his daughter suffering from a sore eye;
another because a relative has died; a third because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
his brother-in-law has brought an action against him
for money lent, and he has had to pay; one because
his family is small, and another because it is large;
another—and this is the most common excuse—because
he has been unable to sell his stock; another
because his wife has a sore hand; another because of
the death of a cow; another because the weather is
severe and there is a sheriff’s bailiff obstructing him
from making up the rent; another because it was
God’s will to take all the means he had; another
because of the agitation.”</p>

<p>Reasons which, it may be seen, appear to the
English eye entirely ridiculous and unbusiness-like.</p>

<p>What strikes a Frenchman most, on the other hand,
in the letters, is their touching simplicity, the appalling
instability of a budget that the least domestic
mishap is enough to upset, and the fruitless attempt
of the poor man to penetrate into the real cause of
the burden under which he is panting; in the comments,
the utter incapacity of the British landlord to
understand his Irish tenantry even when he is a good
landlord, which is obviously (perhaps too obviously)
the case here.</p>

<p>The letters are thus characteristic in more than one
sense. Whatever the angle under which they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
read, they undoubtedly remain first-class documentary
evidence.</p>

he had no further instructions than what was contained in his
note. Now my Uncle has been confined through illness to his
bed since last June, &amp; my daughter has been under medical
treatment since last September for a sore eye which proceeded
from a bad tooth, &amp; I even had to pay the Dentist ten shillings
for extracting it, as the Doctor could not do so. I trust you will

had to leave it having means to live &amp; he requested to come to
live with me which I allowed, &amp; being maintained as one of my
family for 12 months up to Wedy. last he now sued me for
£50 which he lent me while here. He is at other lodgings &amp;
subject to evil advice but he fell out with me while here &amp; since
has been most ungrateful. I done my best to get this law put
back but failed &amp; had to pay the money I had made to pay my
rent. I am much grieved being obliged to ask to the middle of
next month to pay it. I wont have any fairs sooner to sell my

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
